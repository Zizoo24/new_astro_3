# Future Research Queries

Research topics identified during the content strategy audit (February 7, 2026). These are high-priority areas that need actual data before content creation.

---

## 1. Arabic Keyword Demand Data (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Why:** 117 Arabic pages exist with zero search volume data. Arabic is 60% of content effort but decisions are based on assumptions, not data.

**Research needed:**
- Google Keyword Planner: Arabic terms (ترجمة عقود, ترجمة شهادة ميلاد أبوظبي, ترجمة رخصة قيادة, etc.)
- "People Also Ask" scraping for top 20 Arabic keywords
- Google Search Console: Arabic page impressions vs clicks (what's ranking but not getting clicked?)
- Compare Arabic search volume against English for same services
- Identify Arabic long-tail keywords with commercial intent

## 2. Nationality-Specific Document Rejection Data

**Why:** "Rejection prevention" is Pillar 2 of the content strategy. Real rejection data is unfakeable content that no competitor has.

**Research needed:**
- **Indian:** MEA apostille rejection reasons. State-by-state HRD differences. Which Indian universities get flagged by MOHESR? Distance learning degree acceptance rates.
- **Pakistani:** Nikah Nama-specific GDRFA rejection reasons. IBCC equivalence issues. NADRA vs Union Council document acceptance at different entities.
- **Filipino:** PSA vs NSO certificate confusion. Red ribbon apostille issues. DHA DataFlow verification failures for nurses.
- **Egyptian:** Cairo University degree format issues. Arabic-to-Arabic "translation" needs (Egyptian dialect → UAE legal Arabic). Supreme Council of Universities verification failures.
- **Bangladeshi:** New Hague member (March 2025) — what changed? Are entities still asking for embassy attestation despite apostille eligibility?

**How to get this data:**
- Interview typing center staff (they see rejections daily)
- Ask GDRFA Amer center officers informally
- Check expat forums (ExpatWoman, Reddit r/dubai, Facebook groups)
- Track WhatsApp inquiries mentioning "rejected" or "refused"

## 3. Abu Dhabi Process-Level Detail

**Why:** Abu Dhabi is Phase 2, fewer competitors, growing ADGM demand. But content needs granular process detail.

**Research needed:**
- **TAMM:** Which of the 1,000+ services require translated documents? Map each service to translation type needed.
- **ADGM company formation:** What foreign-language documents need English translation? Step-by-step with screenshots if possible.
- **ADEK (Abu Dhabi Education):** School enrollment transfer certificate requirements. How do they differ from Dubai's KHDA?
- **ADJD vs Dubai Courts:** Specific document formatting differences. Do they accept the same MOJ stamp?
- **DOH (Dept of Health):** Healthcare professional licensing requirements. How does it differ from DHA's DataFlow?
- **Abu Dhabi Municipality:** Business licensing document requirements vs DED Dubai.

## 4. Google "People Also Ask" Content Gaps

**Why:** PAA boxes reveal exact questions people are asking. Each is a content opportunity.

**Research needed (scrape PAA for these seed queries):**
- "legal translation Dubai"
- "MOJ translation UAE"
- "document translation for visa UAE"
- "birth certificate translation Dubai"
- "marriage certificate translation Dubai"
- "degree attestation UAE"
- "MOFA attestation Dubai"
- "GDRFA document requirements"
- "work permit translation UAE"
- "Golden Visa documents UAE"

**Expected high-value PAA questions:**
- "Is notarized translation same as legal translation UAE?"
- "How long does MOJ translation take?"
- "Can I translate my own documents for UAE visa?"
- "What happens if translation is rejected by GDRFA?"
- "Do I need Arabic translation for UAE bank account?"

## 5. Competitor Arabic Content Audit (Quarterly)

**Why:** Alsun is the only Arabic competitor. Need to track if Al Syed or others enter Arabic.

**Research needed:**
- Alsun Arabic page count across all 3 domains (quarterly check)
- Al Syed Arabic presence (currently zero — confirm quarterly)
- New competitor Arabic pages from: Sim-Trans, Polyglot, Communication Dubai, Aburuf
- Arabic SERP rankings for top 10 Arabic keywords
- Compare our 117 Arabic pages against Alsun's 55-65

---

## 6. Format Innovation Research

**Why:** Zero competitors offer PDFs, calculators, or interactive tools. This is a genuine moat.

**Research needed:**
- What international translation companies (Translated.com, TransPerfect, Lionbridge) offer in digital tools
- Document type identifier feasibility (upload photo → identify document → recommend translation type)
- PDF checklist templates by use case (GDRFA visa, MOHRE work permit, DHA licensing, school enrollment)
- Cost estimator by document type and urgency — what data is needed?
- WhatsApp chatbot: Can it pre-qualify documents via image recognition?

---

## 7. Google Review Campaign Data

**Why:** Alsun has 256+ reviews vs OT.ae <10. This gap affects local pack rankings.

**Research needed:**
- Current Google review count and rating
- Competitor review velocity (reviews per month)
- Best practices for WhatsApp-based review requests (timing, wording)
- QR code placement strategy for physical encounters
- Review response templates

---

## 8. Vercel Staging Site Deindexing (Technical)

**Why:** Duplicate content risk from indexed staging sites.

**Research needed:**
- Which Vercel preview URLs are indexed? (site:*.vercel.app onlinetranslation)
- Are replit/manus staging sites still live?
- How to add noindex to Vercel preview deployments
- Check Google Search Console for crawl errors from old URLs
