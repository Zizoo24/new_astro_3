# Blog Ideas (Personal / Non-Site)

## 1. GitHub PRs as Time Travel and Parallel Worlds

**Concept:** Git branches as parallel universes, pull requests as the moment timelines converge. Like a sci-fi movie where characters from different realities meet and have to reconcile their versions of events.

**Angles:**
- Each branch is a parallel world where different decisions were made
- Merge conflicts = paradoxes when two realities contradict
- PR reviews = negotiating which timeline becomes canonical
- `git rebase` = rewriting history (actual time travel)
- `git cherry-pick` = stealing a single event from another timeline
- Force push = erasing a timeline from existence
- The "main" branch = the prime timeline everyone agrees on
- Deleted branches = collapsed timelines that no longer exist but once did

**Movie parallels:** Everything Everywhere All at Once, The Flash, Spider-Verse, Tenet, Primer

## 2. Autism and ADHD as Remnant Powers from a Pre-Apocalyptic World

**Concept:** What if traits classified as "disorders" were actually optimized abilities for a previous civilization — one that required different cognitive profiles? The modern world pathologizes what was once essential.

**Angles:**
- ADHD hyperfocus = designed for rapid threat scanning and pattern detection in a high-stimulus environment
- Autism = deep-system analysis and pattern recognition for maintaining complex infrastructure
- Sensory sensitivity = calibrated for detecting environmental changes (useful in a world where that mattered)
- "Executive dysfunction" = priorities calibrated for a different world's demands
- Social norms they struggle with are *new* constructs — maybe the old world didn't have them
- The "spectrum" = different specialization roles in the old civilization
- Why these traits persist genetically despite modern "disadvantage" — because they weren't disadvantages before
- Medication as "dampening powers to fit a world that doesn't need them anymore"

**Tone:** Speculative fiction meets neuroscience. Not dismissing real struggles, but reframing the narrative.
