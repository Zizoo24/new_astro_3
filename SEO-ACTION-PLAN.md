## Phase 1: Quick Wins (Weeks 1-2)

| Page | Issue | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| `/personal/academic/degree/` | 64 chars, high impressions | Shorten title |
| `/locations/abu-dhabi/` | 65 chars | Shorten title |
| Other high-impression pages | Various | Review and shorten |

### 1.2 Meta Description Optimization

High-impression, low-CTR pages need compelling descriptions:

|------|----------|-------------|-----|-----|
| `/personal/academic/transcripts/` | 8.3 | 1,306 | 0.23% | Promise outcome, add urgency |
| `/personal/academic/degree/` | 9.3 | 999 | 0.30% | Add benefit + price |
| `/specialized/medical/dha-dataflow/` | 9.97 | 1,045 | 0.29% | Simplify, focus on approval |
