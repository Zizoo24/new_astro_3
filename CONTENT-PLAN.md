# Content Strategy: Own the Journey (EN + AR)

**Site**: OnlineTranslation.ae
**Version**: 3.0
**Created**: February 6, 2026
**Replaces**: v2.0 (English-only plan)

---

## What Changed in v3.0

The February 2026 Al Syed competitive analysis revealed a critical insight: the company that ranks #1-2 for "legal translation Dubai" in English has **zero Arabic pages**. Meanwhile, OnlineTranslation.ae already has **~82 Arabic pages** — more than any single competitor domain. The Arabic content gap is not page count, it is optimization and strategic expansion.

**Key changes:**
- Added Arabic content as a parallel track (not an afterthought at Phase 4)
- Arabic optimization runs alongside English content creation from Week 1
- New Arabic-specific content priorities: authority guides, blog posts, location pages
- Target: 120+ Arabic pages by end of 19-week plan
- Corrected competitor profiles: Al Syed (translationindubai.com) and Alsun are distinct competitors

---

## Why the Old Plan Failed

The January 2026 plan targeted generic keywords: "legal translation dubai" (position 70), "translation services dubai" (position 21). Research revealed why this can't work:

- **Al Syed** has 350+ pages on translationindubai.com targeting these exact terms (#1-2 for "legal translation Dubai")
- **Alsun** runs a bilingual, multi-domain strategy across 3+ domains with 256+ Google reviews
- **CLT** has operated since 1996, **AGATO** for 20+ years
- **15+ competitors** fight for "legal translation dubai"
- We have ~100 English pages. We cannot win a volume war in English.

**What we stopped:**
- Chasing "legal translation dubai" and "translation services dubai" head terms
- Publishing 2 generic blog posts per week
- Writing about "why choose us" or "top translation services"
- Competing on English content volume
- Treating Arabic content as a Phase 4 afterthought

---

## The Strategy: Two Parallel Tracks

### Track 1: English — Own the Journey, Not the Keyword

Every person who needs a translation is in the middle of a larger process: getting a work permit, applying for Golden Visa, licensing as a healthcare professional, settling an estate. Translation is step 3 of 7.

**Al Syed's game:** Rank for "translation services Dubai" (generic, brutal competition)
**Alsun's game:** Rank for "legal translation Dubai" in English AND Arabic (bilingual, multi-domain)
**Our game:** Rank for the entire journey where translation is a required step — in both languages

**Why this works:**
- Zero translation companies create authority-specific process content (validated across 40+ searches)
- aburuf.ae proved the model: one ADJD will registration guide ranks them for will translation
- Translayte.com (UK) proved it for MOHRE: one work visa guide outranks Dubai-based companies
- OnlineTranslation.ae already ranks for MOFA attestation content

### Track 2: Arabic — Volume Play in a Low-Competition Space

Al Syed proves content volume drives rankings. They used this to win English head terms. We apply the same principle to Arabic, where:
- Al Syed has zero pages (invisible)
- Alsun has ~40-70 pages across 3 domains (beatable)
- OnlineTranslation.ae already has ~82 pages on one .ae domain (needs optimization)

**Arabic content is not a translation of English content.** Arabic pages need their own keyword research, Abu Dhabi-first geographic targeting, and content suited to Arabic-speaking audiences (UAE nationals, long-term residents, government employees).

---

## IMPORTANT: Content Creation Guidelines

Before writing ANY content from this plan, read:
- **CLAUDE.md Part I** — Verify Hague Convention facts (UAE is NOT a member)
- **CLAUDE.md Part V** — Follow page structure and readability (max 25 word sentences)
- **CLAUDE.md Part VI** — Match brand voice, avoid banned words
- **CLAUDE.md Part IV** — Implement correct schema markup
- **pipeline/MASTER_WORKFLOW.md** — Full content creation process
- **SEO_ARABIC_KEYWORDS.md** — Arabic keyword targets and formulas (for Arabic content)

---

## The 4 English Content Pillars

### Pillar 1: Authority Process Guides

"How to get your [document] accepted by [authority]"

Not "we translate for MOHRE." Instead: "How to get your work permit through MOHRE — complete document guide." Captures people BEFORE they search for "translation." Our deep knowledge of GDRFA, DHA, MOFA is the moat.

### Pillar 2: Rejection Prevention

"Why [authority] rejected your application"

Only someone with operational experience can write this. It's unfakeable. This is the content people search for at 11pm in a panic — high intent, zero competition. Across 40+ searches, no translation company has built rejection-prevention as a content category.

### Pillar 3: Decision Content (Right-Selling)

"When you DON'T need MOJ certification — and save AED 150"

Contrarian. Every competitor says "buy everything." We say "here's what you actually need." Builds trust, gets shared, earns links naturally. OnlineTranslation.ae's existing MOJ vs Certified post is already the best decision-making piece found across all searches.

### Pillar 4: Nationality-Specific Guides

"Indian degree holders: MOHRE work permit translation guide"

People search by their situation, not by "translation." 1.45 million Bangladeshi and Egyptian expats have virtually zero nationality-specific document content targeting them. Each guide naturally incorporates Hague Convention status — our verified expertise.

---

## What We're NOT Doing

- Publishing 350 thin blog posts to match Al Syed's volume (their game in English)
- Competing for "translation services Dubai" head terms
- Writing "10 best translation companies" listicles
- Creating generic "why choose us" content
- Pretending to be an agency with hundreds of linguists
- Treating Arabic as a carbon-copy translation of English content

---

## Competitive Landscape by Authority

Research validated across 40+ searches (February 2026):

| Authority | Translation Co. Competition | Content Quality | Our Opportunity |
|-----------|---------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **MOHRE** | 1 competitor (Translayte, UK) | 3/5 | Highest volume. All content targets employers, not employees. |
| **GDRFA** | Zero competitors | 2.5/5 | Every expat needs residency. No guide connects attestation-translation-submission. |
| **DHA** | Zero competitors | 3.5/5 | Dominated by exam prep. Zero post-licensing coverage. |
| **MOFA** | We already rank here | 4/5 | Consolidate. Diminishing returns. |
| **MOHESR** | Zero competitors | 4/5 | Translation angle completely untouched. |
| **DIFC** | Zero competitors | 4/5 (law firms) | Common law vs civil law translation goldmine. Dubai Law No. 2 of 2025. |
| **ADJD** | 1 competitor (aburuf.ae) | 3/5 | Proof the model works. Expand beyond wills. |
| **ADGM** | Zero competitors | 2/5 | Biggest content desert. 31% growth in registrations. |

---

## Nationality-Specific Demand

| Nationality | UAE Population | Content Competition | Hague Member? | Priority | Primary Search Language |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|----------|------------------------|
| Bangladeshi | 920K (7.4%) | Virtually zero | Yes (2025) | HIGH | English |
| Egyptian | 530K (4.2%) | Almost nothing | No | HIGH | Arabic |
| Pakistani | 2.09M (17%) | Moderate gaps | No | Medium | English |
| Filipino | 760K (6%) | DHA-focused only | Yes (2019) | Medium | English |
| Indian | 4.75M (38%) | Very high (saturated) | Yes (2005) | Low ROI | English |
| British | 240K (2%) | Well-served | Yes (1965) | Low ROI | English |

**Arabic angle:** Egyptian expats search primarily in Arabic. Arabic nationality content for Egyptians targets 530K people in a space where Al Syed has zero presence and Alsun has limited coverage.

## Execution Phases — Dual Track (English + Arabic)

Each phase now has both an English and Arabic component running in parallel.

### Phase 1: Rejection Prevention + Arabic Optimization (Weeks 1-3)

**English Track:**

| # | Content | Type | URL | Target Query |
|---|---------|------|-----|--------------|
| 1 | "GDRFA visa rejected? Document problems that cause delays and how to fix them" | Blog | `/blog/gdrfa-visa-document-problems/` | gdrfa visa rejected documents |
| 2 | "MOHRE work permit rejected: common document issues employees miss" | Blog | `/blog/mohre-work-permit-document-issues/` | work permit rejected UAE |
| 3 | "What translation type do I need? MOJ vs Certified vs Notarized — by authority" | Resource | `/resources/translation-type-decision-guide/` | what translation do I need UAE |

**Arabic Track:**

| # | Task | Type | Details |
|---|------|------|---------|
| A1 | Optimize 20 highest-priority Arabic page titles and meta descriptions | SEO | Apply `SEO_ARABIC_KEYWORDS.md` formulas, Abu Dhabi first |
| A2 | Optimize Arabic homepage (title, meta, H1, hero) | SEO | Target: ترجمة قانونية معتمدة في أبوظبي |
| A3 | Optimize Arabic legal translation page | SEO | Target: مكتب ترجمة قانونية في أبوظبي |
| A4 | Add Arabic FAQ sections to top 5 Arabic service pages | Content | FAQPage schema in Arabic |

**Content approach (English):**
- Frame around the PROBLEM (rejection, delay, confusion), not the service (translation)
- Include specific authority portal screenshots or step references where possible
- End with "how proper translation prevents this" — natural service connection
- Each piece 2,000-3,000 words following CLAUDE.md structure

**Content approach (Arabic):**
- Use keyword formulas from `SEO_ARABIC_KEYWORDS.md`
- Abu Dhabi appears before Dubai in all title tags and meta descriptions
- FAQ sections in natural Arabic (not machine-translated)
- Internal links between Arabic pages (not just EN↔AR hreflang)

## Measuring Success

### Old Metrics (Retired)

- ~~"Legal translation dubai" position~~ — not our game anymore
- ~~2 posts per week~~ — replaced by 1 English + 1 Arabic per week
- ~~Generic keyword rankings~~ — replaced by authority-specific queries

### New Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | 8-Week Target | 16-Week Target |
|--------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| English pages ranking for [authority] + translation queries | 1 (MOFA) | 4 | 8 |
| Arabic pages with >50 impressions/month | Unknown | 5 | 15 |
| Blog posts with >100 impressions/month | ~3 | 6 | 10 |
| English clicks from non-brand queries | ~20/month | 40/month | 80/month |
| Arabic clicks from non-brand queries | Unknown | 10/month | 30/month |
| "People Also Ask" appearances | Unknown | 3+ | 8+ |
| Resource pages in top 10 | ~2 | 5 | 10 |
| Arabic pages in GSC top 20 | Unknown | 10 | 25 |

### Leading Indicators (Check Weekly)

- Are new English pages getting indexed within 7 days?
- Are Arabic pages generating impressions in GSC?
- Are authority-specific queries showing impressions within 14 days?
- Are FAQ schemas triggering "People Also Ask" boxes?
- Which nationality guides get the most impressions fastest?
- Are Arabic title/meta optimizations improving CTR?

### Validation Signals

**English validation:** If Phase 1 content (rejection prevention) gets meaningful impressions within 4 weeks, the English strategy is working.

**Arabic validation:** If Arabic page title/meta optimizations improve Arabic keyword positions within 4 weeks, the Arabic strategy is working. Check GSC Performance filtered to /ar/ pages.

If either track fails to show results, reassess before continuing.
