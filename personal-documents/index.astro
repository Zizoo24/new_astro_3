    question: 'Which personal documents need certified translation in the UAE?',
    answer: 'Any document submitted to UAE government entities (GDRFA, ICP, MOHRE, RTA, courts) must be translated by an MOJ-certified translator. This includes birth certificates, marriage certificates, degrees, driving licenses, police clearances, and bank statements. Documents for private use (personal reference, non-official purposes) do not require certification.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does personal document translation take?',
    answer: 'Standard certificates (birth, marriage, driving license) are typically completed within 60 minutes. Bank statements and academic transcripts take 2-4 hours depending on length. University degrees with multiple pages may take up to 24 hours. We provide exact timelines after reviewing your specific document.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do my documents need attestation before translation?',
    answer: 'It depends on the purpose. For most visa applications, documents need the full attestation chain (home country notarization, foreign ministry, UAE embassy, MOFA) before translation. For some purposes like school enrollment or bank account opening, unattested translations may be accepted. We check your specific requirement and advise accordingly.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if my name is spelled differently on different documents?',
    answer: 'Name inconsistencies are the most common cause of government rejections. We translate names exactly as they appear on the source document, then flag any discrepancies with your passport or Emirates ID. We can add a translator note explaining variations (e.g., transliteration differences) which authorities typically accept.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate documents in languages other than Arabic and English?',
    answer: 'Yes. We translate from 50+ source languages into Arabic or English. Common languages include Hindi, Urdu, Tagalog, French, German, Russian, Chinese, Spanish, and Portuguese. All translations receive the same MOJ certification regardless of source language.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to bring original documents to your office?',
    answer: 'No. Send a clear photo or scan via WhatsApp. We work from digital copies for translation. If you need a physical stamped copy, we can courier it to you. For attestation services that require original documents, we arrange secure pickup and delivery.'

      <h2>The Expat Guide to Document Translation in the UAE</h2>
      
      <p>Living in the UAE means navigating a constant stream of paperwork. Visa applications, school enrollments, driving license conversions, bank account openings—each requires translated documents that meet specific government standards. Understanding these requirements saves you time, money, and the frustration of rejected applications.</p>

      <h3>Why Personal Documents Need Certified Translation</h3>
      
      <p>The UAE government requires all foreign-language documents to be translated into Arabic (and sometimes English) by translators registered with the Ministry of Justice. This is not bureaucratic formality—it ensures legal validity and prevents fraud. A translation without the MOJ stamp has no official standing, regardless of how accurate it may be.</p>
      
      <p>Each government entity has specific formatting expectations. GDRFA applications require translations in a particular layout. RTA driving license conversions need specific details highlighted. School enrollment offices expect transcripts presented in familiar formats. We know these requirements because we process hundreds of documents monthly for each authority.</p>

      <h3>The Attestation Question</h3>
      
      <p>One of the most common questions we receive: Does my document need attestation before translation? The answer depends entirely on your purpose.</p>
      
      <p>For visa applications and government submissions, most documents require the full attestation chain: notarization in your home country, authentication by your foreign ministry, attestation by the UAE embassy, and final MOFA stamp in the UAE. Only after this chain is complete should you translate the document.</p>
      
      <p>For other purposes—school enrollment, bank account opening, employment verification—unattested translations are often accepted. We always check your specific requirement before quoting, ensuring you do not pay for attestation you do not need.</p>

      <h3>Timing Matters</h3>
      
      <p>Several personal documents have validity windows that affect when you should get them translated. Police clearance certificates typically expire within 3-6 months of issue. Bank statements are usually valid for only 30 days. Medical fitness certificates have similar short windows.</p>
      
      <p>Getting a translation too early means your document may expire before you can use it. Getting it too late means rushing and paying premium fees. We advise on optimal timing based on your specific application timeline.</p>
