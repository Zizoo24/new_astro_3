## Technical Notes

### CSS Architecture
- **Canonical CSS location:** `public/styles/` (NOT `src/styles/`)
- **Key files:**
  - `porto-desktop.css` - Base desktop styles
  - `navigation-glassmorphism.css` - Header/nav styling
  - `sticky-mobile.css` - Mobile bottom bar
  - `mobile-ios.css` - iOS-specific adjustments
  - `dark-mode.css` - Dark theme overrides

### Component Architecture
- **Layouts:** `BaseLayout.astro`, `ServiceLayout.astro`, `CategoryLayout.astro`
- **Reusable components:** `PageHero`, `ServiceHero`, `CTASection`, `TrustStrip`, `ProcessSteps`, `BenefitCards`, `AccordionSection`
- **Data pattern:** Service pages use `pageData` object passed to ServiceLayout

### Service Worker
- **Current version:** v152
- **Bump version** after any CSS/JS changes to bust cache

### Mobile Sidebar Contrast (visibility-fixes.css)
- Sidebar background is forced to navy via `visibility-fixes.css`
- All sidebar text must use light colors (white/rgba(255,255,255,x))
- Hover/active states should use white text, not accent color
