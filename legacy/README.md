# Legacy / Archived Planning Documents

This folder contains completed implementation plans that have been fully executed and are archived for historical reference.

## Why Archive Plans?

Completed planning documents are moved here to:
1. Keep the root directory clean and focused on active work
2. Preserve historical context for future reference
3. Track what strategies have been implemented
4. Provide examples for future planning documents
