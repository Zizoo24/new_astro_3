# Content Review: Existing Pages vs "Own the Journey" Strategy

**Date**: February 6, 2026
**Scope**: 18 blog posts + 21 resource pages audited against 4-pillar strategy
**Related**: [CONTENT-PLAN.md](./CONTENT-PLAN.md) | [RESEARCH.md](./RESEARCH.md) | [SEO-STRATEGY.md](./SEO-STRATEGY.md)

## Overview

| Category | Total | Keep | Expand | Rework | Deprioritize |
|----------|-------|------|--------|--------|--------------|
| Blog Posts | 18 | 14 | 0 | 2 | 2 |
| Resource Pages | 21 | 14 | 2 | 1 | 4 |
| **Total** | **39** | **28 (72%)** | **2 (5%)** | **3 (8%)** | **6 (15%)** |

**Bottom line:** 72% of existing content aligns with the new strategy. The foundation is solid. The gaps are specific: nationality-specific guides (Pillar 4) and standalone rejection-prevention content (Pillar 2).

## Pillar Coverage Assessment

| Pillar | Blog Posts | Resource Pages | Total | Strength |
|--------|-----------|----------------|-------|----------|
| 1: Authority Process Guides | 11 | 5 | 16 | STRONG — but ADJD, ADGM, MOHESR gaps |
| 2: Rejection Prevention | 2-3 (embedded) | 2 | 4-5 | WEAK — only embedded, no standalone guides |
| 3: Decision / Right-Selling | 5 | 6 | 11 | STRONGEST — clear differentiator |
| 4: Nationality-Specific | 1 (US only) | 2 (US + Japan) | 3 | VERY WEAK — 1.45M people unserved |
| None (utility/off-strategy) | 2 | 4 | 6 | Deprioritize |

### Rework (2 posts) — Good topics, wrong angle

| Post | Current Angle | Rework To | Pillar |
|------|---------------|-----------|--------|
| `why-machine-translation-fails` — "Meat in Bread Cylinder" | Thought leadership / entertainment | Reframe as Pillar 3 decision content: "When AI Translation Works (and When It Doesn't) — A Quick Check" | 3 |
| `uae-arrival-paperwork` — UAE Arrival Paperwork Guide | General tips for new arrivals | Reframe as Pillar 1 authority guide: organize by authority (GDRFA first, then MOHRE, then RTA) instead of by timeline | 1 |

### Deprioritize (2 posts) — Off-strategy

| Post | Why Deprioritize | Action |
|------|------------------|--------|
| `certified-translator-uae/` — How to Become a Certified Translator | Targets translators, not translation clients. Doesn't support customer journey. | Move to `/resources/` as a reference. Remove from blog promotion. Still indexed — don't delete. |
| `us-citizens-dubai-documents` — US Expats Dubai Documents | Wait — this IS Pillar 4, but it duplicates `/resources/us-citizens-dubai-guide/` which is more comprehensive. | Consolidate. Keep the resource page. Redirect blog post to resource page, or merge content into the resource page. |

## Resource Pages: Full Assessment

### Keep (14 pages) — Aligned with strategy

| Page | Pillar(s) | Why Keep |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `attestation-guide/` — Attestation Guide | 1 | MOFA/Embassy authority process guide. Country-specific. ~4,000 words. |
| `authenticated-translation/` — Authenticated Translation | 3 | "When you DON'T need MOJ." ~3,500 words. |
| `case-studies/` — Case Studies Hub | N/A | E-E-A-T trust building. Essential. |
| `case-studies/rejected-document-rescue/` — Rejected Document Rescue | 2 | Specific court rejection reasons. Zero competition angle. ~2,200 words. |
| `court-interpreter-guide/` — Interpreter vs Translator | 3 | Right-selling: "you need interpretation, not translation." ~2,800 words. |
| `distance-education-uae/` — Distance Education Degrees | 3 | "When you DON'T need equivalency." ~4,200 words. |
| `golden-visa-attestation-guide/` — Golden Visa Attestation | 1 | ICP authority process guide. ~3,500 words. |
| `golden-visa-checklist/` — Golden Visa Checklist | 1 | Category-specific checklists. ~3,200 words. |
| `index/` — Resources Hub | N/A | Navigation hub. Essential. |
| `japan-visa-guide/` — Japan e-Visa Guide | 4 | Nationality-specific (UAE residents). Niche. ~2,800 words. |
| `mohesr-equivalency/` — MOHESR Equivalency | 1 + 3 | Dual-pillar: authority guide + "when you DON'T need equivalency." ~3,800 words. |

| `visa-rejection-guide/` — Visa Rejection Guide | 2 | GDRFA/immigration rejection prevention. ~3,600 words. |

### Expand (2 pages) — Partially aligned, need depth

| Page | Current State | Expansion Needed | Target Pillar |
|------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| `case-studies/dha-dataflow-deadline/` — DHA DataFlow Deadline | Narrow (single case, DHA only). ~2,800 words. | Expand into broader "What DHA requires after DataFlow" guide. Add: all license types, document list by profession, common delays. Connect to GDRFA/MOHRE downstream requirements. | 1 |
| `golden-visa-checklist/` — Golden Visa Checklist | Good checklists but lacks authority-specific guidance. ~3,200 words. | Add: explicit ICP requirements per category, common rejection reasons, "degree translation for Golden Visa" section (targets zero-competition query from research). | 1 + 2 |

### Rework (1 page) — Good topic, wrong frame

| Page | Current Frame | Rework To | Target Pillar |
|------|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| `case-studies/urgent-family-visa/` — Urgent Family Visa | Success story / turnaround narrative. ~2,500 words. | Reframe as "GDRFA Family Visa: Complete Document Checklist" — keep the case study as a sidebar but restructure around GDRFA's actual requirements, document order, and typical denial reasons. | 1 |

### Deprioritize (4 pages) — Utility, not strategy-aligned

| Page | Why Deprioritize | Action |
|------|------------------|--------|
| `document-checklist/` — Document Preparation Checklist | Generic file format advice. No authority-specific value. ~1,800 words. | Keep indexed but remove from resource hub prominence. Content could merge into authority-specific guides. |
| `faq/` — General FAQ | Generic Q&A about services. ~1,900 words. | Keep indexed. Consider splitting authority-specific questions into authority guides over time. |
| `pricing-guide/` — Pricing Guide | Service-focused utility. ~2,200 words. | Keep indexed (people search for pricing). But don't invest in expansion. |
| `turnaround-times/` — Turnaround Times | Operational utility. ~2,000 words. | Keep indexed. No SEO investment. |

## Content Gaps: What's Missing

### Critical Gaps (Mapped to CONTENT-PLAN.md Phases)

**Pillar 2: Rejection Prevention — Only 2 existing pieces**

The biggest gap. Only `rejected-document-rescue/` (court-specific) and `visa-rejection-guide/` (GDRFA/immigration) exist. Missing:

| Gap | Phase | Priority | Notes |
|-----|-------|----------|-------|
| GDRFA visa rejection — document-specific causes | Phase 1 (Week 1) | HIGHEST | Zero competition. High-panic search intent. |
| MOHRE work permit rejection — employee document issues | Phase 1 (Week 2) | HIGHEST | Zero competition. All existing MOHRE content targets employers. |
| DHA credential rejection — post-DataFlow issues | Phase 2 (Week 6) | HIGH | Expand from DHA case study. |

**Pillar 4: Nationality-Specific — Only 3 existing pieces (US, Japan)**

| Gap | Phase | Priority | Notes |
|-----|-------|----------|-------|
| Bangladeshi workers guide (920K population) | Phase 3 (Week 8) | HIGHEST | Virtually zero English content exists. Recently joined Hague Convention (March 2025). |
| Egyptian professionals guide (530K population) | Phase 3 (Week 9) | HIGHEST | Almost no content exists. Not Hague member. |
| Pakistani families guide (2.09M population) | Phase 3 (Week 10) | HIGH | Moderate gaps. Not Hague member. |

**Pillar 1: Authority Process Guides — Missing Authorities**

| Gap | Phase | Priority | Notes |
|-----|-------|----------|-------|
| MOHRE employee-facing work permit guide | Phase 2 (Week 5) | HIGHEST | All existing content targets employers. Zero employee guides. |
| GDRFA family visa document checklist | Phase 2 (Week 4) | HIGH | No guide connects attestation → translation → submission. |
| ADGM translation requirements | Phase 4 (Week 12) | MEDIUM | Biggest content desert. Zero competition. |
| DIFC judgment enforcement translation | Phase 4 (Week 13) | MEDIUM | Dubai Law No. 2 of 2025 creates clear requirement. |
| ADJD court translation requirements | Phase 4 (Week 14) | MEDIUM | Circular No. 8 exemptions are differentiating detail. |

## Deprioritized Content: What Happens to It

These 6 pages are NOT deleted. They stay indexed and accessible. We simply stop investing time in them and reduce their prominence in navigation/hub pages.

| Page | Current Prominence | New Prominence | Reason |
|------|-------------------|----------------|--------|
| `certified-translator-uae/` (blog) | Blog listing | Unlinked/archived | Targets translators, not clients |
| `us-citizens-dubai-documents` (blog) | Blog listing | Redirect to resource page | Duplicate of better resource page |
| `document-checklist/` (resource) | Resource hub card | Footer link only | Generic utility |
| `faq/` (resource) | Resource hub card | Footer link only | Generic; answers belong in authority guides |
| `pricing-guide/` (resource) | Resource hub card | Keep current | People search for pricing; maintain but don't expand |
| `turnaround-times/` (resource) | Resource hub card | Footer link only | Operational; no SEO value |
