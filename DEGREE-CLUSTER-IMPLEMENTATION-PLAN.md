## Internal Linking Strategy

### Principle: "Extreme Internal Linking"
Every new page should link to 8+ relevant pages. Every relevant existing page should link back to new pages. This creates a dense link web that:
- Passes PageRank/authority to new content
- Helps Google discover and index new pages faster
- Reduces bounce rate by offering next steps
- Builds topical clusters that signal expertise

### Outbound Links (FROM new pages)
```
