# Translation SEO Expansion Plan
## Data-Driven Strategy to Capture Organic Translation Traffic

**Created:** January 8, 2026
**Based on:** Google Analytics (Dec 29 - Jan 7, 2026), SEMrush Keyword Gap Analysis
**Core Problem:** Attestation leads don't convert (0% revenue). Translation leads convert at 10% but organic volume is low.

---

## Executive Summary

### The Real Situation

| Metric | Your Site | Alsun (Competitor) |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Keywords Ranking | 29 | 616 (21x more) |
| Attestation Lead Revenue | 0% | Unknown |
| Translation Lead Conversion | 10% | Unknown |

**Key Insight:** You're getting attestation inquiries that don't convert. You need MORE translation traffic, not attestation-to-translation funnels.

### Strategy Shift

| Old Assumption | New Reality |
|----------------|-------------|
| "Leverage attestation to get translation clients" | Attestation leads don't convert to revenue |
| "Create new `/translation/` silo" | Work within existing 6-silo structure |
| "50+ page content blitz" | Optimize existing pages first, then expand strategically |

---

## Quick Win Opportunities (From SEMrush Data)

### Keywords Where You're Close to Ranking

| Keyword | Volume | KD% | Your Rank | Alsun Rank | Action |
|---------|--------|-----|-----------|------------|--------|
| marriage certificate translation dubai | 110 | 12% | #39 | #2 | **OPTIMIZE NOW** |
| legal translation abu dhabi | 140 | 13% | #84 | #33 | **CREATE/EXPAND** |
| certified translation certificate | 90 | 19% | #93 | #4 | **OPTIMIZE** |

### Keywords Where Alsun Dominates (Long-term targets)

| Keyword | Volume | KD% | Your Rank | Alsun Rank |
|---------|--------|-----|-----------|------------|
| translation office dubai | 1,000 | 54% | #86 | #2 |
| accredited translation services | 880 | 50% | #76 | #1 |
| translation company in dubai | 880 | 47% | #81 | #2 |
| translation services dubai | 880 | 40% | #76 | #1 |

### Arabic Keywords (Massive Untapped Opportunity)

| Keyword (Arabic) | Translation | Volume |
|------------------|-------------|--------|
| ترجمة الجوازات عربي | passport translation | 165,000 |
| ترجمة عربي انجليزي | Arabic-English translation | 135,000 |
| مترجم الجوازات عربي | passport translator | 49,500 |
| ترجمة بالعربي | translation in Arabic | 40,500 |

**Note:** Your `/عربي/` page exists but likely isn't optimized for these high-volume queries.

| Don't | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Create `/translation/` silo | Duplicates existing structure, causes confusion |
| Focus on attestation-to-translation funnels | Attestation leads don't convert (0% revenue) |
| Plan 50+ pages in 6 months | Unrealistic, quality over quantity |
| Assume competitor weaknesses | Verify claims before building strategy |
| Ignore Arabic opportunity | 400K+ monthly searches untapped |
| Skip technical SEO | Foundation must be solid first |
