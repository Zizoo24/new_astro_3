# SEO Strategy & Competitive Landscape

**Site**: OnlineTranslation.ae
**Version**: 2.0
**Updated**: February 6, 2026
**Data Sources**: GSC (Dec 2025 - Jan 2026), competitive audit (Feb 2026, 40+ searches)

## Executive Summary

The January 2026 strategy focused on generic keyword rankings ("legal translation dubai" at position 70). A comprehensive competitive audit in February 2026 revealed this approach is unwinnable:

| Reality | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Al Alsun has 350+ posts across 5 domains | Cannot win a volume war with 18 posts |
| 15+ competitors fight for "legal translation dubai" | Generic head terms are oversaturated |
| Zero translation companies target authority-specific queries | Process-knowledge content is wide open |
| OnlineTranslation.ae already ranks for MOFA attestation | The "own the journey" model is proven |

**Strategic pivot:** Stop chasing generic keywords. Own the document journey where translation is a required step. See [`CONTENT-PLAN.md`](./CONTENT-PLAN.md) for the full execution plan.

## Part I: What We Stopped Targeting

### Retired Keywords (Generic Head Terms)

These keywords are not worth pursuing with content. Existing pages will continue to rank where they do, but no new investment.

| Keyword | Position | Why Retired |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| legal translation dubai | 70.33 | 15+ competitors, Al Alsun dominates with 350+ posts |
| legal translation services dubai | 87.00 | Same competitive set, position too deep to recover |
| translation company dubai | 28.42 | Brand keyword — competitors have decades of domain authority |
| dubai translation services | 23.92 | Generic, low conversion intent |

### What We Keep

| Keyword | Position | Impressions | Why Keep |
|---------|----------|-------------|----------|
| proofreading services dubai | 1.2 | 30 | Already #1. Defend position. |
| translation services dubai | 3.8 | 87 | Strong position. Maintain, don't invest heavily. |
| arabic translation dubai | 5.1 | 45 | Strong. Maintain. |
| degree certificate translation dubai | 5.29 | 42 | Near top 5. Expand with MOHRE/Golden Visa angle. |
| moj translation dubai | ~1 | - | Only #1 ranking. Core brand query. Defend. |

## Part II: Competitive Landscape (February 2026 Audit)

### The Generic Keyword Battlefield (Avoid)

| Competitor | Domain Age | Content Volume | Approach |
|------------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| Al Alsun (alsuntranslation.com + 4 domains) | 10+ years | 350+ posts | Mass content across 5 domains |
| CLT (clt-translate.com) | Since 1996 | 100+ pages | Enterprise brand authority |
| AGATO (agato-translation.com) | 20+ years | 50+ pages | Industry reputation |
| Prime Translation (primetranslation.ae) | 5+ years | 50+ pages | Mid-market content |
| Dubai Translation Service (dubaitranslationservice.com) | Since 2002 | 30+ pages | Long-tail SEO |

**Verdict:** Competing here requires 5-10x our current content volume AND years of domain authority. Not viable.

### The Authority-Specific Landscape (Our Territory)

| Authority | Who Ranks Today | Translation Company Presence | Our Strategy |
|-----------|----------------|------------------------------|--------------|
| **MOHRE** | HR tech (Pebl, Remote), PRO companies | 1 — Translayte.com (UK-based) | Employee-facing process guide (all existing content targets employers) |
| **GDRFA** | PRO/Amer centers, typing centers, visa agencies | Zero | Family visa document checklist, rejection prevention |
| **DHA** | Exam prep academies, recruitment consultancies | Zero | Post-licensing document preparation (nobody covers this phase) |
| **MOFA** | Attestation companies (QuickAttest, GloboPrime) | Us — already ranking | Consolidate. Don't over-invest. |
| **MOHESR** | PRO companies (attestationuae.ae, eduprime.ae) | Zero | Language-specific angle: "degree in French/Hindi/Urdu — what translation for MOHESR?" |
| **DIFC** | International law firms (CMS, K&L Gates) | Zero | Practical translation guide for judgment enforcement (Dubai Law No. 2 of 2025) |
| **ADJD** | Will-writing services, law firms | 1 — aburuf.ae (proves the model) | Court translation requirements + Circular No. 8 exemptions |
| **ADGM** | Official ADGM.com only | Zero | Biggest content desert. 31% growth in registrations. |

### Nationality-Specific Landscape

| Nationality | Population | Content Status | Opportunity |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Bangladeshi | 920K | Virtually zero English content | Highest ROI — massive underserved audience |
| Egyptian | 530K | Almost nothing | Second highest ROI — biggest gap relative to population |
| Pakistani | 2.09M | Moderate gaps | Good ROI — families underserved |
| Filipino | 760K | DHA/healthcare only | Niche opportunity for non-healthcare workers |
| Indian | 4.75M | Saturated | Low ROI — too competitive |
| British | 240K | Well-served by UK apostille firms | Low ROI |

## Part III: Technical SEO Status

### Redirects

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total redirects in vercel.json | 309 |
| WordPress infrastructure paths blocked (robots.txt) | 10 |
| Legacy OnehourX brand redirects | 12 |
| Legacy translation_agency_dubai redirects | 15+ |

### Indexing Status

| Status | Count | Action |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Indexed | ~100 pages | OK |
| Crawled not indexed | 10 | New internal links from authority content should help |
| Discovered not indexed | 33 | Authority guides will create link paths to these |

### Critical Technical Issues

| Issue | Severity | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 5 Vercel staging sites indexed by Google | HIGH | Requires Vercel dashboard access — noindex headers or delete deployments |
| Legacy WordPress pages in Google cache | MEDIUM | 309 redirects in place. Google needs to re-crawl. |
| robots.txt WordPress blocks | DONE | wp-admin, wp-login, wp-json, xmlrpc, wp-content, wp-includes blocked |

### Page Performance

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| CTR crisis pages (0 clicks) | < 3 | ~5 remaining |

| Monthly clicks (non-brand) | 80+ | ~20 |
| FAQ rich snippet appearances | 8+ | Unknown |

## Part IV: What The Data Proves

### Validated Assumptions

1. **Process-guide content works for translation companies.** aburuf.ae ranks for ADJD will registration with one guide. Translayte.com (UK) outranks Dubai-based companies for MOHRE work visa content. OnlineTranslation.ae ranks for MOFA attestation.

2. **Authority-specific queries have zero translation company competition.** Across 8 major UAE authorities and 40+ searches, only 3 translation companies create any process-guide content (including us).

3. **Rejection prevention content doesn't exist.** Zero results across 9 targeted searches for "visa rejected + translation" or "document rejected + [authority]." Stravision.ae claims 20% rejection rate for sequencing/translation errors — the demand exists, the content doesn't.

4. **Nationality-specific document guides don't exist from translation companies.** 1.45 million Bangladeshi and Egyptian expats have virtually no English-language document content. Attestation companies create country pages, but not nationality-specific process guides.

5. **The old approach cannot work.** "Legal translation dubai" has 15+ entrenched competitors with decades of domain authority and 5-10x our content volume. No amount of blog posts changes this math.

### Open Questions (Monitor)

- Will Phase 1 rejection-prevention content get indexed and earn impressions within 4 weeks?
- Which authority queries generate the highest CTR?
- Do nationality-specific guides attract the target audience or mostly generic traffic?
- Is 1 substantial piece per week sufficient publishing pace?
