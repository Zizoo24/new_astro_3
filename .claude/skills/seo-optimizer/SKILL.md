<h1>Main Page Title (Primary Keyword)</h1>
  <h2>Section Heading (Related Keywords)</h2>
    <h3>Subsection</h3>
  <h2>Another Section</h2>
```

**URL Structure:**
- Clean, readable, keyword-relevant
- Use hyphens, not underscores
- Keep short and descriptive

**Image Optimization:**
- Descriptive, keyword-rich alt text
- Compress images (WebP format preferred)

### 3. Content Quality (E-E-A-T)

**E-E-A-T Principles:**

### 4. Technical SEO

**Schema Markup:** Use JSON-LD format for Article, FAQ, HowTo, LocalBusiness, Service, BreadcrumbList

**Robots.txt:** Block admin/private paths, include sitemap reference

**Canonical Tags:** Prevent duplicate content, handle URL parameters

### 5. Core Web Vitals

| Metric | Target | Fix |
|--------|--------|-----|
| LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) | < 2.5s | Optimize images, use CDN, minimize render-blocking |
| INP (Interaction to Next Paint) | < 200ms | Minimize JS, break up long tasks |
| CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) | < 0.1 | Set image dimensions, avoid dynamic content insertion |

### 6. Internal Linking Strategy
