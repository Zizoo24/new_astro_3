const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What types of board resolutions require translation?',
    answer: 'Common resolutions requiring Arabic translation include: bank account opening/signatory changes, appointment or removal of directors, share transfers, dividend declarations, property purchase authorizations, and general meeting minutes. Any resolution submitted to UAE banks, government entities, or courts needs certified translation.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why is signatory name accuracy so important?',
    answer: 'Banks reject documents where director names differ even slightly from passport or Emirates ID. "Mohammed" vs "Mohamed" or missing middle names cause rejections. We cross-reference resolution signatories with official ID documents to ensure exact matching. This step prevents costly resubmissions.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do resolutions need attestation before translation?',
    answer: 'It depends on the use case. For UAE banks accepting foreign company documents, resolutions typically need notarization, foreign ministry authentication, UAE Embassy attestation, and MOFA stamp before translation. For local companies, the original company stamp may suffice. We advise based on your specific requirements.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle circular resolutions vs meeting minutes?',
    answer: 'Both require precise translation but have different formats. Circular resolutions (written consent without meeting) must show the consent mechanism clearly. Meeting minutes must preserve the formal record of proceedings, including voting counts and abstentions. We maintain appropriate formal language for each type.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate resolutions in languages other than English?',
    answer: 'Yes. We frequently translate board resolutions from Chinese, Hindi, French, German, and other languages into Arabic for UAE use. Multi-language resolutions from international companies are common—we ensure consistent treatment across the full document.'

      <h2>The Importance of Resolution Translation Accuracy</h2>
      <p>A board resolution is more than a corporate formality—it's the legal foundation for specific business actions. When you present a resolution to a bank, government entity, or business partner, they rely on it to verify that proper corporate authorization exists.</p>
      
      <p>Translation errors undermine this function. A signatory name that doesn't match passport spelling will cause bank rejection. Ambiguous authority language may not cover the intended transaction. Missing effective dates create uncertainty about when authority begins.</p>
      
      <p>Our translators understand corporate governance. They know that "resolved" versus "recommended" has different legal effect. They recognize that authority granted to "any director" differs from authority requiring "two directors jointly." This attention to governance detail ensures your translated resolutions function as intended.</p>
