const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'Is Arabic translation required for Ejari registration?',
    answer: 'Ejari accepts both Arabic and English lease contracts. However, if your original lease is in another language (Chinese, French, Hindi, etc.), you will need certified translation into Arabic or English for registration. Arabic translation is also required if you anticipate any disputes that might go to the Rental Disputes Center.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What lease terms require special translation attention?',
    answer: 'Rent payment terms, security deposit conditions, maintenance responsibilities, and early termination clauses are critical. We also pay careful attention to rent increase provisions, subletting restrictions, and any special conditions like pet policies or modification rights.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you translate commercial leases?',
    answer: 'Yes. Commercial leases often include additional complexity: fit-out periods, rent-free periods, trading hour requirements, and business-specific restrictions. We understand commercial tenancy terminology and ensure all operational terms are accurately translated.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate leases for RDC disputes?',
    answer: 'Yes. The Rental Disputes Center requires Arabic documentation. We provide translations formatted for RDC submission, ensuring all relevant clauses are clearly presented for dispute proceedings. We can also translate supporting correspondence and notices.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How quickly can you translate a lease?',
    answer: 'Standard residential leases (5-10 pages) are typically completed within 6-12 hours. Commercial leases with extensive schedules may require 24-48 hours. Rush service is available for urgent Ejari deadlines.'

      <h2>Lease Translation for Dubai's Rental Market</h2>
      <p>Dubai's rental market operates under RERA regulations that provide specific tenant and landlord protections. Lease contracts interact with these regulations—some contractual terms override defaults, while others are unenforceable if they conflict with law.</p>
      
      <p>Our translators understand this regulatory framework. When translating a lease, we ensure that legally significant terms are rendered with precision. A maintenance clause that shifts responsibility to the tenant must be clearly translated to have legal effect. An eviction provision must align with statutory notice requirements.</p>
      
      <p>For dispute situations, translation quality becomes critical. The Rental Disputes Center relies on the Arabic text to understand contractual rights. Ambiguous translation can undermine valid claims or create obligations that weren't intended.</p>
