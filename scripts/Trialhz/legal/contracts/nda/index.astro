const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'Why does NDA translation require special attention?',
    answer: 'NDAs define what information is protected and what happens if protection is breached. Ambiguous translation of the confidential information definition could exclude critical data from protection. Weak translation of remedy provisions could limit your legal recourse. Every clause needs precision to maintain enforceability.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What NDA sections are most critical?',
    answer: 'The definition of Confidential Information is paramount—it determines what is protected. Exclusions (publicly known information, independently developed materials) must be equally precise. Duration provisions, permitted disclosures, and return/destruction obligations also require careful translation to preserve their legal effect.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you translate both bilateral and unilateral NDAs?',
    answer: 'Yes. Unilateral NDAs (one-way confidentiality) and bilateral/mutual NDAs (both parties share confidential information) have different structures. We ensure the directional obligations are clear—who is disclosing, who is receiving, and what duties apply to each party.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does NDA translation take?',
    answer: 'Standard NDAs (3-5 pages) are typically completed within 6-12 hours. Complex NDAs with extensive schedules or industry-specific provisions may require 24 hours. Rush service available for urgent business deals.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Are translated NDAs enforceable in UAE courts?',
    answer: 'Yes. UAE courts recognize and enforce NDAs governed by UAE law. For NDAs governed by foreign law, UAE courts may still enforce them under conflict of law principles. The Arabic translation is what courts will interpret, making translation accuracy essential for enforcement.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What about NDAs in languages other than English?',
    answer: 'We translate NDAs from Chinese, French, German, Hindi, and other languages into Arabic. International business partnerships often involve multi-language NDAs—we ensure consistent protection across all versions.'

      <h2>Protecting Your Confidential Information</h2>
      <p>NDAs are often the first legal document in a business relationship—signed before sharing the information that makes deals possible. This makes translation quality critical from the very start of your engagement.</p>
      
      <p>Consider what happens if the confidential information definition is too narrow in translation: data you intended to protect might be excluded. Or if permitted disclosure language is too broad: recipients might share your information with parties you never intended to reach.</p>
      
      <p>Our legal translators understand NDA structure and purpose. They preserve the protective intent of every clause while ensuring the Arabic version uses terminology that UAE courts recognize and enforce.</p>
