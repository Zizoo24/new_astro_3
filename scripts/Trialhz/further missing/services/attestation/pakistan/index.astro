const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What is HEC attestation?',
    answer: 'The Higher Education Commission (HEC) attests Pakistani university degrees and transcripts. This verification confirms the degree is genuine and the awarding institution is recognized. HEC attestation is required before MOFA Pakistan authentication for all higher education documents.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What about school certificates (Matric/Inter)?',
    answer: 'Matriculation and Intermediate certificates require IBCC (Inter Board Committee of Chairmen) attestation rather than HEC. IBCC verifies secondary education credentials from Pakistani education boards. After IBCC, documents proceed to MOFA Pakistan.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Which Pakistani documents need attestation for UAE?',
    answer: 'Common documents include: university degrees (HEC route), matric/inter certificates (IBCC route), NADRA birth certificates, marriage certificates (Union Council or NADRA), police character certificates, and professional licenses. Most Pakistani documents need the full attestation chain for UAE acceptance.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does Pakistan attestation take?',
    answer: 'The complete chain typically takes 10-15 working days: HEC/IBCC (3-5 days), MOFA Pakistan (2-3 days), UAE Embassy (3-5 days), shipping (2-3 days), and MOFA UAE (1-2 days). Processing times can vary based on current workloads.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you handle documents from any Pakistani city?',
    answer: 'Yes. We coordinate attestation for documents from all Pakistani cities. Our partners operate in Islamabad (for embassy and federal offices) and Karachi (for consulate and Sindh documents). Documents from Punjab, KPK, Balochistan, and other regions are processed through appropriate channels.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if my degree is from a private university?',
    answer: 'Private university degrees require HEC attestation confirming the institution is HEC-recognized and the degree program is approved. Some older private university degrees may face additional verification requirements. We advise on specific requirements for your institution.'

      <h2>Serving the Pakistani Community in UAE</h2>
      <p>The Pakistani community in the UAE spans professionals, laborers, entrepreneurs, and families who have made the Emirates home. This community requires ongoing attestation services—from initial employment documentation to family sponsorship papers.</p>
      
      <p>Pakistan's attestation system has unique requirements. The HEC/IBCC layer for educational documents is specific to Pakistani credentials. Different document types follow different verification paths before reaching MOFA Pakistan. Understanding these paths prevents wasted time and rejected applications.</p>
      
      <p>Our partners in Islamabad and Karachi process Pakistani documents daily. They navigate HEC online verification systems, IBCC requirements, and MOFA procedures efficiently. Whether you need a university degree attested for employment or birth certificates for family sponsorship, we handle the complexity.</p>
