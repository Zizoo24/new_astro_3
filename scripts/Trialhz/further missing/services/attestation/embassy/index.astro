const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What is UAE Embassy legalization?',
    answer: 'UAE Embassy legalization (or attestation) is the process of having the UAE Embassy in your home country verify that your documents are authentic and properly authenticated. The embassy confirms that your document was legitimately authenticated by your country Foreign Ministry, then applies their official attestation stamp.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why is embassy attestation required?',
    answer: 'Embassy attestation bridges your home country authentication and UAE government acceptance. UAE MOFA only accepts documents that bear a UAE Embassy stamp—this confirms a UAE government representative verified the document in the country of origin. Without embassy attestation, MOFA will not process your documents.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Which UAE Embassy handles my documents?',
    answer: 'Documents should be attested by the UAE Embassy in the country that issued them. An Indian degree certificate goes to the UAE Embassy in India. A UK birth certificate goes to the UAE Embassy in London. Documents issued in countries without UAE Embassy may require processing through a designated third country.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does embassy attestation take?',
    answer: 'Processing times vary by embassy and current workload. Most UAE Embassies complete attestation within 3-7 working days. Some embassies offer express services for additional fees. We provide realistic timelines based on current embassy processing speeds in your specific country.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I do embassy attestation myself?',
    answer: 'Yes, if you are in the country where the UAE Embassy is located. You would need to complete prior authentication steps, gather required documents, schedule an appointment, and submit in person. Our service is valuable when you are already in UAE or prefer professional handling of the process.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What documents does the embassy require?',
    answer: 'Requirements vary slightly by embassy but typically include: original documents with all prior authentication stamps, passport copy, application form, and applicable fees. Some embassies require additional supporting documents for specific certificate types. We provide country-specific checklists.'

      <h2>The Embassy's Role in Document Authentication</h2>
      <p>The UAE Embassy serves as the UAE government's representative in your home country. When they attest your documents, they're confirming to UAE authorities that they personally verified the document's authenticity at the source.</p>
      
      <p>Embassy officials check that proper local authentication was completed—they verify foreign ministry stamps, confirm document formatting meets standards, and ensure the authentication chain is unbroken. Only then do they apply the UAE Embassy attestation stamp that MOFA will later verify.</p>
      
      <p>This in-country verification is why embassy attestation cannot be skipped or done remotely. The physical presence of your documents at the UAE Embassy, with all prerequisite stamps visible, is what creates the chain of trust that UAE authorities rely upon.</p>
