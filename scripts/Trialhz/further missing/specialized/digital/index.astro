const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between translation and localization?',
    answer: 'Translation converts text from one language to another. Localization adapts content for a specific market—including cultural references, local examples, appropriate imagery descriptions, date/time formats, and regional preferences. A localized website feels native to Arabic speakers, not like a translated English site.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why do Arabic websites need special technical consideration?',
    answer: 'Arabic reads right-to-left (RTL), which affects entire page layouts. Navigation moves to the right, text alignment flips, and some design elements need mirroring. Our localization includes guidance on RTL implementation, though actual development remains with your team.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle Arabic SEO?',
    answer: 'Arabic SEO requires native keyword research—users search differently in Arabic than in English. We research actual Arabic search terms in your industry, optimize meta titles and descriptions, and ensure content targets realistic Arabic search intent. Direct translation of English keywords often misses how Arabic speakers actually search.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you localize mobile apps?',
    answer: 'Yes. We handle app string localization for iOS and Android, including UI text, notifications, in-app content, and app store descriptions. We understand character limits and context constraints that affect mobile translation. Deliverables provided in standard formats (.strings, .xml, JSON).'
  },
  {
    question: 'What about e-commerce product descriptions?',
    answer: 'E-commerce localization includes product titles, descriptions, specifications, and category structures. We optimize for Arabic shopping search behavior and ensure product information is complete and compelling for Arabic-speaking buyers.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you offer ongoing localization services?',
    answer: 'Yes. Many clients need continuous localization for new content, product updates, and marketing campaigns. We offer retainer arrangements with established glossaries and style guides to ensure consistency across all your Arabic content.'

      <h2>Why Localization Matters for Arabic Markets</h2>
      <p>Arabic-speaking internet users expect Arabic digital experiences. A translated website that feels foreign or awkward undermines trust and conversion. Users notice when content was clearly written for another market and adapted as an afterthought.</p>
      
      <p>Effective localization goes beyond language. It considers how Arabic speakers search, what cultural references resonate, how trust signals differ across markets, and how user experience expectations vary. A localized site anticipates these differences and addresses them.</p>
      
      <p>Search visibility adds another dimension. Google's Arabic search results favor content written for Arabic speakers, not translated content optimized for English keywords. Our localization includes Arabic keyword research and SEO optimization to ensure your content is discoverable.</p>
