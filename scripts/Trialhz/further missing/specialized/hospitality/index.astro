const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'Why can\'t I just translate my menu literally?',
    answer: 'Literal menu translation often produces unappetizing or confusing results. "Spotted Dick" (a British dessert) translated literally would be inappropriate. "Surf and Turf" has no direct Arabic equivalent. Our hospitality translators create descriptions that convey the dish appeal to Arabic-speaking diners, not just the ingredients.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you handle menu design and layout?',
    answer: 'We provide translated text that integrates with your existing design. Arabic reads right-to-left, which affects layout considerations. We can advise on design adjustments and deliver text formatted for your design software. For complete design services, we partner with specialized hospitality designers.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What about dietary and allergen information?',
    answer: 'Allergen information requires precise translation—this is a safety issue. We use standardized Arabic terminology for common allergens and ensure dietary indicators (vegetarian, halal, gluten-free) are clearly communicated. We understand UAE food labeling requirements.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate hotel guest communications?',
    answer: 'Yes. We translate in-room directories, welcome letters, spa menus, activity guides, and guest correspondence. We maintain the hospitality tone expected in premium properties while ensuring practical information is clearly communicated.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you work with tourism operators?',
    answer: 'Yes. We translate tour descriptions, itineraries, booking confirmations, and destination guides. Tourism content requires balancing promotional appeal with practical accuracy—we understand this balance.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle luxury brand voice?',
    answer: 'Luxury hospitality requires elevated language that conveys exclusivity without being pretentious. Our translators understand how to render luxury brand voice in Arabic, maintaining sophistication while respecting Arabic language conventions and cultural expectations.'

      <h2>Beyond Translation: Cultural Adaptation</h2>
      <p>Hospitality content must do more than communicate—it must appeal. A menu description should make a dish sound delicious. A hotel welcome should make guests feel valued. Tourism content should inspire booking decisions.</p>
      
      <p>This requires cultural adaptation, not just translation. Arabic speakers have different food vocabulary, different expectations of hospitality language, and different cultural references. A dish described as "melt-in-your-mouth tender" needs Arabic language that conveys the same sensory appeal, not a literal translation.</p>
      
      <p>Our hospitality translators work with restaurants, hotels, and tourism operators throughout Dubai and the GCC. They understand what language resonates with Arabic-speaking guests—whether you're operating a fine dining establishment, a family resort, or an adventure tourism company.</p>
