    question: 'What types of technical documents do you translate?',
    answer: 'We translate engineering specifications, equipment manuals, safety documentation, ISO procedures, tender documents, technical datasheets, installation guides, maintenance procedures, and industrial process documentation. We handle documents from mechanical, electrical, civil, chemical, and software engineering disciplines.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do your translators have technical backgrounds?',
    answer: 'Yes. Our technical translators hold engineering degrees or have extensive industry experience. This domain expertise is essential—technical translation requires understanding what terms mean in context, not just finding dictionary equivalents. A "bearing" in mechanical engineering is different from a "bearing" in navigation.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle measurement conversions?',
    answer: 'We follow client preferences for measurement systems. Some projects require conversion from imperial to metric (or vice versa), while others must preserve original units. We clearly note converted values and can provide dual-unit formatting where standards require it.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate CAD drawings and technical diagrams?',
    answer: 'Yes. We translate text within technical drawings, including callouts, labels, dimensions, and notes. We can work with various CAD formats and deliver translated text in formats compatible with your design software. The visual layout is preserved while text elements are translated.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you ensure terminology consistency?',
    answer: 'We build project-specific glossaries during translation, ensuring the same technical term is translated identically throughout your documentation. For ongoing clients, we maintain terminology databases that carry across projects, ensuring consistency in all your Arabic technical content.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What about Dubai Municipality submission requirements?',
    answer: 'We understand Dubai Municipality documentation requirements for construction, MEP, and civil engineering submissions. Translations are formatted to meet DM standards, including proper technical terminology for building codes, safety requirements, and permit applications.'

      <h2>Why Technical Translation Requires Specialists</h2>
      <p>Technical documents are built on precise terminology developed over decades of engineering practice. A "check valve" and a "non-return valve" refer to the same device—a general translator might not know this, creating inconsistency or confusion in your documentation.</p>
      
      <p>Our technical translators understand these equivalencies because they've worked with the equipment and processes being described. They know that "torque to specification" has different implications than "tighten securely." They understand why a safety procedure must be translated with absolute precision.</p>
      
      <p>This expertise extends to format and structure. Technical documentation follows conventions—warning hierarchies, procedural steps, reference numbering—that must be preserved in translation. Our output matches the professional standards of your original documentation.</p>
