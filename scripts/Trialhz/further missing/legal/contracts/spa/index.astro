  {
    question: 'Why does DLD require Arabic SPA translation?',
    answer: 'Dubai Land Department operates under UAE civil law with Arabic as the official language. All property registration documents must be in Arabic or accompanied by certified Arabic translation. The translation becomes part of your official property records and is referenced in any future disputes or transactions.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What SPA sections require special attention?',
    answer: 'Payment schedules are critical—especially for off-plan purchases where milestone payments tie to construction progress. Handover conditions, penalty clauses for delays, and defect liability periods must be translated with precision. We also pay careful attention to force majeure clauses and dispute resolution mechanisms.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you translate off-plan SPAs?',
    answer: 'Yes. Off-plan SPAs require additional care due to their complexity. Construction milestone definitions, payment percentage allocations, expected completion dates, and developer obligations must all be accurately translated. We understand RERA regulations and ensure translations reflect the regulatory framework.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does SPA translation take?',
    answer: 'Standard SPAs (10-20 pages) are completed within 24-48 hours. Complex agreements with multiple annexures or off-plan schedules may require 2-3 business days. Rush service is available for urgent property closings—contact us for same-day options.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate SPAs from other emirates?',
    answer: 'Yes. While DLD handles Dubai properties, we also translate SPAs for Abu Dhabi (ADRED), Sharjah, and other emirates. Each emirate has slightly different registration requirements, and we format translations accordingly.'

      <h2>Why SPA Translation Matters</h2>
      <p>A Sale Purchase Agreement is more than a contract—it's the foundation of your property ownership in Dubai. The Arabic translation becomes part of your official property records at DLD and is referenced in any future transactions, disputes, or inheritance matters.</p>
      
      <p>Inaccurate translation creates real risks. A mistranslated payment milestone could result in penalty charges. Ambiguous handover conditions may leave you without recourse for construction delays. Unclear penalty clauses might not protect you as intended.</p>
      
      <p>Our translators understand Dubai's property market and RERA regulations. We've translated thousands of SPAs for developments across Dubai—from Palm Jumeirah villas to Downtown apartments to Dubai Marina towers. This experience means we know exactly how to handle the terminology that matters for your registration.</p>
