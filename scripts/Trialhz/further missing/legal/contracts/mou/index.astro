const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between MOU and contract translation?',
    answer: 'MOUs typically establish preliminary understanding before formal contracts, using softer commitment language. Translation must preserve this distinction—terms like "shall endeavor" versus "shall" carry different legal weight. We ensure the Arabic translation maintains the same level of obligation (or lack thereof) as the original.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Are MOUs legally binding in the UAE?',
    answer: 'It depends on the language used. UAE courts have enforced MOUs containing binding language, while dismissing those clearly marked as non-binding. The translation must accurately reflect the original intent. We flag ambiguous provisions that could be interpreted differently in Arabic legal context.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you translate government MOUs?',
    answer: 'Yes. Government-to-business and inter-governmental MOUs require particular care with official titles, department names, and protocol language. We understand UAE government terminology and ensure translations meet formal documentation standards.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle confidentiality provisions in MOUs?',
    answer: 'Confidentiality clauses in MOUs often use specific legal terminology that must be preserved. We translate these provisions with the same precision as NDAs, ensuring the scope of confidentiality, exclusions, and duration are clearly rendered in Arabic.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate MOUs in languages other than English?',
    answer: 'Yes. We translate MOUs from Chinese, French, German, Hindi, and 40+ other languages into Arabic and English. Multi-language MOUs involving international partners are common in Dubai business environment.'

      <h2>The Importance of MOU Translation Precision</h2>
      <p>MOUs occupy a unique space in commercial relationships—they're often intended to be non-binding expressions of intent, yet UAE courts have enforced MOUs that contain sufficiently binding language. This makes translation particularly critical.</p>
      
      <p>Consider an MOU stating parties "shall use best efforts" to complete a transaction. In English, this creates a meaningful but limited obligation. The Arabic translation must capture this exact level of commitment—not stronger, not weaker. Using language that implies absolute obligation or mere aspiration would change the document's legal effect.</p>
      
      <p>Our translators understand these nuances. We identify binding provisions within otherwise non-binding documents, flag language that could be interpreted differently across legal systems, and ensure your MOU maintains its intended effect in Arabic.</p>
