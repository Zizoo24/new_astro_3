const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'Why do foreign court judgments need translation?',
    answer: 'Foreign judgments must be translated for UAE court recognition and enforcement. Under UAE Civil Procedure Law and relevant treaties, courts require certified Arabic translations to understand the foreign judgment terms, parties, and ruling before considering enforcement or recognition.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What judgment sections require special attention?',
    answer: 'The operative clause (the actual ruling) is most critical—this determines what must be enforced. Party identification, case numbers, dates, and any monetary amounts must be precisely translated. Legal reasoning sections, while important for context, require accurate rendering of the court legal analysis.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you translate judgments from non-English languages?',
    answer: 'Yes. We translate court judgments from French, German, Chinese, Hindi, Russian, and other languages into Arabic for UAE enforcement. Multi-language judgments from international courts are handled with consistent terminology throughout.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle different legal systems?',
    answer: 'Common law judgments (UK, US, DIFC) differ structurally from civil law judgments (France, Germany, UAE mainland). Our translators understand these differences and use appropriate Arabic legal terminology for each tradition while ensuring UAE courts can understand the foreign judgment.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate provisional or interim orders?',
    answer: 'Yes. Interim injunctions, provisional measures, and interlocutory orders require translation for urgent enforcement. We offer expedited service for time-sensitive court orders that require immediate UAE court action.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What about judgments for UAE court enforcement?',
    answer: 'Judgments intended for UAE enforcement typically require attestation before translation. The attestation chain (apostille or embassy route) authenticates the judgment before the UAE court considers it. We advise on the complete process from foreign judgment to UAE enforcement.'

      <h2>Translation for UAE Court Recognition</h2>
      <p>Foreign judgments don't automatically apply in the UAE. Recognition and enforcement require presenting the judgment to UAE courts, which assess whether the foreign court had jurisdiction, whether due process was followed, and whether enforcement would violate UAE public policy.</p>
      
      <p>This assessment happens through the Arabic translation. UAE judges read the translated judgment to understand what the foreign court decided and why. A poor translation can obscure the judgment's meaning, potentially affecting the recognition decision.</p>
      
      <p>Our litigation translators understand what UAE courts look for. They know to preserve procedural details that demonstrate due process, clearly render party identification that enables proper enforcement, and accurately translate the operative clauses that define what must be done.</p>
