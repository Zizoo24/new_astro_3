  {
    question: 'How are arbitration awards enforced in the UAE?',
    answer: 'Foreign arbitration awards are typically enforced under the New York Convention, to which the UAE is a signatory. The award holder files for enforcement with UAE courts, providing certified Arabic translation of the award. Domestic awards follow UAE Federal Arbitration Law procedures. Both require precise translation for court acceptance.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What arbitral institutions do you work with?',
    answer: 'We translate awards from all major institutions: DIAC (Dubai), ICC (Paris), LCIA (London), SIAC (Singapore), HKIAC (Hong Kong), and ad-hoc arbitrations. Each institution has specific formatting and terminology conventions we understand and preserve.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do DIFC-LCIA awards differ from mainland awards?',
    answer: 'DIFC-LCIA awards benefit from the DIFC Arbitration Law and can be enforced through DIFC Courts. Mainland UAE awards follow Federal Arbitration Law. The translation approach differs—DIFC awards use common law terminology while mainland awards should use civil law Arabic equivalents.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What supporting documents need translation?',
    answer: 'Beyond the final award, enforcement often requires: arbitration agreement, procedural orders, interim measures, and correspondence proving proper notice. We provide translation packages covering all documents needed for enforcement proceedings.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long do arbitration award translations take?',
    answer: 'Final awards typically require 48-96 hours depending on length and complexity. Interim awards and procedural orders can often be completed within 24-48 hours. Urgent enforcement timelines can be accommodated with advance notice.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do awards need attestation before translation?',
    answer: 'Requirements depend on the enforcement route. For New York Convention enforcement, the original award and arbitration agreement must be authenticated per Article IV requirements. For DIFC enforcement, different authentication applies. We advise on the complete documentation chain for your specific situation.'

      <h2>Translation for Enforcement Success</h2>
      <p>An arbitration award is only as valuable as your ability to enforce it. In the UAE, enforcement requires presenting the award to courts that will scrutinize the translation to understand what the tribunal decided and why.</p>
      
      <p>Courts look for specific elements: Was there a valid arbitration agreement? Were the parties properly notified? Did the tribunal have jurisdiction? Is the award consistent with UAE public policy? These questions are answered through the translated award and supporting documents.</p>
      
      <p>Our translators understand what enforcement courts need. They preserve the procedural history that demonstrates due process, accurately render the tribunal's reasoning, and precisely translate the dispositive section that defines the award's practical effect.</p>
