    question: 'What financial documents do you translate?',
    answer: 'We translate financial statements, audit reports, bank statements, investment prospectuses, annual reports, tax documents, loan agreements, insurance policies, and regulatory filings. We also handle internal financial documents like management accounts and budget reports.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do your translators have financial backgrounds?',
    answer: 'Yes. Our financial translators include professionals with backgrounds in accounting, banking, and financial analysis. This expertise ensures they understand context—recognizing that "provisions" in a bank context differs from "provisions" in general business.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle numbers and calculations?',
    answer: 'Financial accuracy is non-negotiable. We preserve all numerical values exactly as they appear, verify that translated figures match originals, and ensure calculations (totals, percentages, ratios) are consistent throughout the document.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What about financial statements for bank submissions?',
    answer: 'We format financial statement translations to meet UAE banking requirements. Banks have specific expectations for how financial information is presented—we ensure translations meet these standards for loan applications, account opening, and credit facilities.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate audit reports?',
    answer: 'Yes. Audit reports require particular care with opinion language—"unqualified," "qualified," "adverse," and "disclaimer" opinions have specific Arabic equivalents. We ensure the audit opinion is translated with its full legal and professional significance preserved.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you ensure confidentiality?',
    answer: 'Financial documents contain sensitive business information. We use secure file handling, limit access to assigned translators, and can sign NDAs for particularly sensitive materials. Data protection is part of our standard process.'

      <h2>Why Financial Translation Requires Specialists</h2>
      <p>Financial terminology is precise for regulatory and professional reasons. "Accrued expenses" and "accounts payable" are related but distinct concepts. An "unqualified" audit opinion is actually the best outcome. These nuances matter in financial documents.</p>
      
      <p>Our financial translators understand these distinctions because they've worked in finance. They recognize IFRS terminology, understand banking conventions, and know how regulatory language should read. This expertise prevents errors that could affect business decisions or regulatory compliance.</p>
      
      <p>Numbers receive particular attention. Financial documents live or die by numerical accuracy. We verify that all figures, calculations, and percentages are correctly rendered and internally consistent throughout the translated document.</p>
