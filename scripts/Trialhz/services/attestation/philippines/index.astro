const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What is the DFA red ribbon?',
    answer: 'The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) red ribbon is the Philippine government authentication confirming a document is genuine. This authentication (featuring a red ribbon seal) is required before the UAE Embassy will attest Philippine documents. It confirms that signatures, seals, and certifications on the document are authentic.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Which Philippine documents need attestation?',
    answer: 'Common documents requiring attestation for UAE use include: PSA birth certificates, PSA marriage certificates, educational credentials (diplomas, transcripts, TOR), NBI clearance, POEA documents, PRC licenses, and employment certificates. Most documents from Philippines need the full attestation chain for UAE acceptance.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need PSA copies or can I use local civil registry?',
    answer: 'For UAE attestation, Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) documents are strongly preferred over local civil registry copies. PSA documents have security features and standardized formats that DFA and UAE Embassy recognize. Local civil registry documents may require additional authentication steps.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does Philippines attestation take?',
    answer: 'The complete chain typically takes 7-14 working days: DFA authentication (1-3 days), UAE Embassy attestation (3-5 days), shipping to Dubai (2-3 days), and MOFA attestation (1-2 days). Rush service may be available at DFA for urgent requirements.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you help if I\'m already in Dubai?',
    answer: 'Yes. Our Manila partners can process documents on your behalf while you remain in Dubai. You would need to send original documents to Philippines via courier. Alternatively, a family member in Philippines can submit documents to our partners for processing.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What about PRC professional licenses?',
    answer: 'Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) licenses for nurses, engineers, teachers, and other professionals require PRC certification before DFA authentication. We coordinate PRC verification as part of the attestation chain for professional credentials.'

      <h2>Serving the Filipino Community in Dubai</h2>
      <p>Filipinos represent one of the largest expatriate communities in the UAE, contributing to healthcare, hospitality, engineering, and countless other sectors. This community has ongoing attestation needs—from initial employment documents to family sponsorship for dependents.</p>
      
      <p>Philippine document attestation follows a specific chain that differs from other countries. The DFA red ribbon authentication is unique to Philippine documents and must be completed before UAE Embassy attestation. Understanding this chain—and having reliable partners in Manila—makes the difference between smooth processing and frustrating delays.</p>
      
      <p>Our Manila partners process documents daily at DFA and UAE Embassy. They know the current requirements, processing times, and any special procedures. Whether you're processing nursing credentials, engineering degrees, or family certificates, we handle the complexity while keeping you informed.</p>
