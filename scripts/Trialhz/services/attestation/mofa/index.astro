const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What is MOFA attestation?',
    answer: 'MOFA (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) attestation is the final step in legalizing foreign documents for use in the UAE. After documents are authenticated by the UAE Embassy in your home country, MOFA verifies the embassy stamp and applies the final UAE government authentication. This confirms the document is genuine and legally valid in the UAE.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Which documents require MOFA attestation?',
    answer: 'Most foreign documents intended for official UAE use require MOFA attestation: educational certificates for employment or licensing, personal documents for visa applications, commercial documents for business setup, and legal documents for court proceedings. Some documents from Hague Convention countries may use apostille instead.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the prerequisite steps before MOFA?',
    answer: 'Documents must complete a chain of authentication: (1) Notarization in the issuing country, (2) Authentication by that country Foreign Ministry or State Department, (3) Attestation by the UAE Embassy in that country. Only after these steps can MOFA attestation proceed. We review your documents to confirm readiness.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does MOFA attestation take?',
    answer: 'Standard MOFA processing takes 1-3 working days after submission. Express service may be available for urgent requirements. Total time including document collection and delivery is typically 3-5 working days. We provide tracking updates throughout the process.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you handle the entire attestation chain?',
    answer: 'Yes. We coordinate the complete attestation process from your home country through MOFA. This includes arranging notarization, foreign ministry authentication, UAE Embassy attestation, and final MOFA legalization. We work with partners in major countries to handle the overseas steps.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need translation before or after MOFA?',
    answer: 'Translation timing depends on your end use. For most purposes, you should complete attestation first, then translate the attested document. This ensures the translation reflects the final authenticated version. We advise on the optimal sequence for your specific situation.'

      <h2>Understanding MOFA's Role</h2>
      <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs serves as the UAE government's final verification point for foreign documents. When you present an attested document to a UAE court, employer, or government agency, they trust it because MOFA has confirmed the authenticity of the entire authentication chain.</p>
      
      <p>MOFA doesn't verify the document content itself—they verify that proper authentication procedures were followed. Their stamp confirms that a legitimate UAE Embassy attested the document, which in turn confirmed Foreign Ministry authentication from the issuing country.</p>
      
      <p>This chain of trust is why attempting to skip steps doesn't work. A document with only embassy attestation (no prior foreign ministry authentication) will be rejected by MOFA. A document with foreign ministry authentication but no embassy attestation cannot proceed. Each step verifies the previous one.</p>
