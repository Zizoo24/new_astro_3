The UAE Golden Visa offers long-term residency for investors, professionals, entrepreneurs, and specialized talents. Success depends on submitting properly translated and attested documents that meet ICA requirements.

## Understanding Golden Visa Categories

The UAE offers Golden Visa through several pathways, each with specific document requirements:

### Investor Category (AED 2M+)

Investors must demonstrate property ownership or business investment of at least AED 2 million. Required documents include:

- **Property title deeds** - translated with exact property descriptions matching DLD records
- **Property valuation** - recent valuation from approved evaluators
- **Bank statements** - showing investment funds or property ownership proof
- **Passport copies** - clear copies of all relevant pages

### Professional Category (AED 30K+ Salary)

Skilled professionals earning AED 30,000 or more monthly can apply with:

- **Degree certificate** - must be MOHESR attested (critical requirement)
- **Employment contract** - current, showing position and salary
- **Salary certificate** - dated within 30 days of application
- **Bank statements** - 6 months showing consistent salary deposits
- **Professional license** - if applicable to your field

### Entrepreneur Category

Startup founders and business owners need:

- **Business plan** - for new ventures
- **Incubator approval** - from approved UAE incubator
- **Company documents** - MOA, trade license, shareholder structure
- **Financial projections** - audited where applicable

## The MOHESR Attestation Process

For professionals, MOHESR (Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research) attestation is mandatory. This verifies your degree is recognized in the UAE.

### Attestation Chain

1. **Home country authentication** - from issuing institution and government
2. **UAE Embassy attestation** - in your home country
3. **MOFA attestation** - Ministry of Foreign Affairs
4. **MOHESR equivalency** - final verification step

The complete chain takes 2-4 weeks. We coordinate the entire process, handling each step in proper sequence.

### Universities Not on the Recognized List

Some universities aren't on MOHESR's recognized list. If this applies to you:

- Consider the **investor route** instead
- Explore **specialized talent categories** focusing on achievements
- Check if your university has alternative recognition pathways

## Common Rejection Reasons

Golden Visa applications fail for preventable reasons:

1. **Missing attestations** - submitting translated but unattested documents
2. **Name inconsistencies** - variations between passport and other documents
3. **Incorrect MOJ certification** - translations without proper ministry stamps
4. **Insufficient financial proof** - bank statements that don't clearly show required amounts
5. **Expired documents** - salary certificates or valuations older than 30 days

## Translation Requirements

All foreign-language documents require MOJ-certified translation. Key considerations:

### Name Consistency

If your name appears as "Mohammed Ahmed" on your degree but "Mohamed Ahmad" on your passport, this triggers verification delays. We cross-reference all documents before translation.

### Financial Document Formatting

Bank statements must clearly show:
- Account holder name matching passport
- Transaction descriptions
- Running balances
- Date ranges covering required period

### Property Document Precision

Title deed translations must match DLD records exactly. Property descriptions, ownership percentages, and unit numbers require precision.

## Timeline Planning

Start document preparation 4-6 weeks before your intended application:

| Stage | Timeline |
|-------|----------|
| Document collection | 1 week |
| Attestation (if needed) | 2-4 weeks |
| Translation | 2-3 days |
| Application review | 1 week |
