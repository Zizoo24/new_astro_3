Police clearance certificates (PCC)—also called good conduct certificates, criminal record checks, or FBI background checks depending on your country—are mandatory for most UAE employment visas and Golden Visa applications. Here's what you need to know about getting your PCC translated and accepted.

## Why the UAE Requires Police Clearance Certificates

The UAE requires PCCs as part of its security vetting for foreign workers. The certificate confirms that you have no criminal record (or discloses any record that exists) in countries where you've lived. This requirement applies to:

- **Employment visa applicants** - most new work visas
- **Golden Visa applicants** - 10-year visa through investment or professional qualification
- **Some residency renewals** - depending on circumstances
- **Certain professional licenses** - healthcare, education, finance

The PCC must be issued by police or government authorities in each country where you've lived for a significant period (typically 6+ months in the past 5-10 years).

## PCC Requirements by Country

Different countries issue PCCs through different authorities and with different formats. Here's what you need to know for common source countries:

### United States

**Issuing Authority:** FBI or state police departments

**FBI Identity History Summary:**
- Apply online through FBI's website
- Fingerprint submission required
- Processing time: 3-5 business days (electronic) to 8-10 weeks (paper)
- Requires apostille from US Department of State (not the issuing state)

**State-Level Checks:**
- Some positions require state-level PCCs in addition to FBI
- Apostille from the Secretary of State of the issuing state

### United Kingdom

**Issuing Authority:** Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) or ACRO Criminal Records Office

**Standard or Enhanced DBS:**
- For UK residents or recent residents
- Apply through an umbrella organization
- Processing time: 2-8 weeks

**ACRO Police Certificate:**
- For non-UK residents who lived in the UK
- Apply directly to ACRO
- Processing time: 2-4 weeks
- Requires FCO apostille

### India

**Issuing Authority:** Regional Passport Office or local police

**Passport Office PCC:**
- Apply at Passport Seva Kendra
- Processing time: 1-3 weeks
- Requires MEA attestation, then UAE Embassy attestation

**Police Station Certificate:**
- Alternative in some cases
- Same attestation requirements

### Pakistan

**Issuing Authority:** Character Certificate Section of local police

**Police Character Certificate:**
- Apply through local police station
- Processing time: 2-4 weeks
- Requires MOFA Pakistan attestation, then UAE Embassy attestation

### Philippines

**Issuing Authority:** National Bureau of Investigation (NBI)

**NBI Clearance:**
- Apply at NBI offices or accredited centers
- Processing time: Same-day to 2 weeks (if "hit" occurs)
- Requires DFA authentication, then UAE Embassy attestation

## The Attestation Chain for PCCs

PCCs follow the same attestation chain as other foreign documents:

### From Apostille Countries (US, UK, EU, Australia)

1. **Obtain PCC** from the relevant authority
2. **Apostille** from the designated authority
3. **MOFA Attestation** in UAE (if required—some uses accept apostille only)

### From Non-Apostille Countries (India, Pakistan, Philippines, most Arab countries)

1. **Obtain PCC** from the relevant authority
2. **Home country foreign ministry** attestation
3. **UAE Embassy attestation** in home country
4. **MOFA Attestation** in UAE

## Translation Requirements

Once your PCC is properly attested, it needs translation if it's not in Arabic:

**For UAE government submission (GDRFA, MOHRE):**
- MOJ-certified Arabic translation is mandatory
- Translation must be done AFTER attestation (the stamps must be visible)
- Our turnaround: 4-8 hours for standard PCCs

**Key translation considerations:**

1. **Name consistency** - The translated name must match your passport and visa exactly
2. **Date format** - We include both Gregorian and Hijri dates where relevant
3. **Clearance statement** - The "no criminal record" statement must be precisely rendered
4. **Official notations** - All stamps, signatures, and reference numbers must be captured

## Validity Periods

PCC validity is one of the most confusing aspects of the process:

**Document Validity:**
- Most countries issue PCCs valid for 3-6 months
- The UAE typically requires PCCs issued within 6 months of submission
- Some employers or authorities require more recent PCCs (3 months)

**Translation Validity:**
- Translations don't expire
- However, if your PCC expires, you'll need a new one and a new translation

**Pro tip:** Time your PCC application so the certificate is fresh when you submit your UAE visa application. Getting a PCC 6 months before you plan to apply creates unnecessary risk.

## Common PCC Translation Issues

### Name Discrepancies

Your PCC will show your name as recorded in that country's systems. If you've used different name spellings or if your name has been transliterated differently, this causes problems.

**Example:** Your FBI check shows "Mohammed Ahmad" but your passport shows "Mohamed Ahmed." The UAE authority may question whether these are the same person.

**Solution:** We flag these discrepancies and can help you understand your options—either getting the PCC reissued with the correct spelling, or obtaining a name verification affidavit.

### Multiple PCCs Required

If you've lived in multiple countries, you may need multiple PCCs. Each needs its own attestation chain and translation.

**Common scenario:** Indian national who worked in the UK before coming to UAE needs both Indian PCC and UK ACRO certificate.

### Hit or Record Listed

If your PCC shows any record—even minor traffic offenses or cases that were dismissed—this must be accurately translated and disclosed. Attempting to hide or minimize records is illegal and will cause far bigger problems if discovered.

## How GDRFA Uses PCCs

For employment visa applications, GDRFA (General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs) reviews your PCC as part of the security clearance process:

1. **Document verification** - GDRFA confirms the attestation chain is complete
2. **Content review** - They assess any disclosed records against UAE entry requirements
3. **Database check** - They may verify against international databases
4. **Approval or inquiry** - Either visa proceeds or additional documentation is requested

A properly translated and attested PCC with no records typically clears quickly. Issues arise with incomplete attestation chains, expired documents, or disclosed records that require additional review.

## Special Cases

### FBI Channeler Results

The FBI allows authorized channelers to submit fingerprints and receive results faster. These channeler results are valid for attestation—ensure you receive the official FBI letterhead version.

### Digital PCCs

Some countries now issue digital or electronic PCCs. For UAE purposes:
- You typically need a physical printed version with official stamps
- Digital verification codes are helpful but don't replace physical attestation
- Contact the issuing authority about obtaining a physical document if needed

### No Criminal Record Affidavits

Some countries don't issue PCCs in the traditional sense. In these cases:
- A sworn affidavit before a notary may be acceptable
- Confirm with UAE authorities before proceeding
- The affidavit needs the same attestation chain as a standard PCC
