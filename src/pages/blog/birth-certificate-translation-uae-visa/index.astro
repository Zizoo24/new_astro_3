          <strong>Immigration Requirement:</strong> UAE authorities require Arabic translation of birth certificates for visa processing. Using non-certified translation or skipping translation entirely causes application rejection and delays. This guide covers exactly what you need.
        </div>

        <h2>Why UAE Visas Require Birth Certificate Translation</h2>

        <p>When you apply for a UAE visa or residence permit, immigration authorities need to verify your identity and family relationships. Your birth certificate establishes your date of birth, nationality at birth, and parentage. <strong>Arabic is the official language of UAE government agencies</strong>, so all supporting documents must be in Arabic or translated into Arabic.</p>

        <p>This requirement applies whether your birth certificate is in English, Hindi, Urdu, Tagalog, or any other language. Even English documents—despite English being widely used in Dubai—require Arabic translation for immigration processing through GDRFA (General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs) and ICP (Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security).</p>

        <h3>When You'll Need Birth Certificate Translation</h3>

        <p>Birth certificate translation is required for employment visa applications and residence permits, family and dependent visa sponsorship, Golden Visa applications, UAE national ID (Emirates ID) processing, spouse visa applications, and child birth registration for UAE-born children of foreign parents.</p>

        <p>Essentially, any interaction with UAE immigration that requires proof of birth will need your birth certificate translated into Arabic by an MOJ-certified translator.</p>

        <h2>Translation Requirements: What UAE Authorities Accept</h2>

        <p>Not every translation will be accepted. UAE immigration has specific requirements for birth certificate translation.</p>

        <h3>MOJ Certification is Required</h3>

        <p>The translation must be performed by a translator registered with the UAE Ministry of Justice. The MOJ translator applies their official stamp and signature, certifying the translation's accuracy. Immigration authorities verify this certification and will reject non-certified translations.</p>

        <p>This means you cannot use Google Translate results, translations done by friends or family members, or non-MOJ certified translation services. The <a href="/services/legal-translation/">MOJ-certified translation</a> requirement exists because birth certificates are legal documents with implications for your visa status.</p>

        <h3>Accuracy is Critical</h3>

        <p>Your translated birth certificate must match your passport and other documents exactly. Immigration officers compare documents during processing. If your name appears differently on the birth certificate translation versus your passport, your application may be rejected or delayed for clarification.</p>

        <p>Pay attention to name spelling (especially transliteration from non-Latin scripts), date format consistency, place names (city and country), and parents' names if included in your application.</p>

        <h2>The Complete Process: From Certificate to Visa</h2>

        <p>Understanding the full process helps you prepare documents correctly and avoid delays.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Attestation (Usually First)</h3>

        <p>For new visa applications, your birth certificate typically needs attestation before translation. The attestation chain depends on your home country and whether your country is part of the Hague Apostille Convention.</p>

        <p><strong>Important:</strong> The UAE is NOT a member of the Hague Apostille Convention. This means apostille alone isn't sufficient for UAE use. You'll need embassy attestation and <a href="/services/attestation/mofa/">MOFA attestation</a> as part of the process.</p>

        <p>The typical chain is home country authentication (notary, state department, or equivalent), UAE Embassy attestation in your home country, and MOFA attestation in the UAE. Your PRO or typing center can confirm the exact requirements based on your nationality.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Translation</h3>

        <p>Once your birth certificate is properly attested, it needs MOJ-certified Arabic translation. The translator converts all content into Arabic while preserving the exact information—names, dates, places, and official stamps.</p>

        <p>Standard turnaround is 24-48 hours. Same-day service is available when you have appointment deadlines.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Submission</h3>

        <p>Submit both the original attested birth certificate and the MOJ-certified translation with your visa application. The immigration officer needs both documents—the original proves authenticity, and the translation makes it readable for processing.</p>

        <h2>Common Mistakes That Cause Rejection</h2>

        <p>These errors are preventable. Knowing them helps you get your documents right the first time.</p>

        <h3>Using Non-Certified Translation</h3>

        <p>The most common mistake. Some applicants use cheap translation services that don't have MOJ certification, thinking any Arabic translation will work. Immigration authorities check for the MOJ stamp. Without it, your application is rejected, and you need to start over with proper translation.</p>

        <h3>Name Discrepancies</h3>

        <p>Your name must be consistent across all documents. If your birth certificate shows "Mohammed" but your passport shows "Muhammad," the translation must match exactly. Highlight any naming variations to your translator so they can note them appropriately.</p>

        <h3>Missing Attestation</h3>

        <p>Translation without prior attestation is often useless for visa applications. If your birth certificate isn't attested, translating it doesn't solve the problem—you'll still be rejected for missing attestation. Confirm attestation requirements before ordering translation.</p>

        <h3>Expired Documents</h3>

        <p>Some immigration applications require recently issued or re-issued birth certificates. If your birth certificate is very old or damaged, you may need to obtain a new certified copy before attestation and translation.</p>

        <h2>Special Situations</h2>

        <h3>Birth Certificates in Non-Latin Scripts</h3>

        <p>Birth certificates in Arabic, Hindi, Urdu, Chinese, or other non-Latin scripts require special attention during translation. The translator must accurately transliterate names (not just translate meaning) while converting the document to Arabic.</p>

        <p>If your name includes characters that don't have direct Arabic equivalents, the translator uses standard transliteration conventions. Ensure this matches how your name appears on your passport.</p>

        <h3>Multi-Page or Supplementary Documents</h3>

        <p>Some countries issue birth certificates with supplementary pages—amendments, name changes, or additional certifications. All pages require translation. Don't leave out supplementary sheets thinking they're not important.</p>

        <h3>Birth Certificates Without English</h3>

        <p>If your birth certificate is in a language other than English (and you need the translation for a DIFC or ADGM matter, or for an embassy that works in English), you may need translation into both English and Arabic. Clarify the requirement with the receiving authority.</p>

        <div class="process-summary">
          <h3>Summary: Birth Certificate Translation Process</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Obtain authenticated/attested birth certificate from your home country</li>
            <li>Complete embassy attestation (if required for your nationality)</li>
            <li>Complete MOFA attestation in UAE</li>
            <li>Get MOJ-certified Arabic translation</li>
            <li>Submit both original and translation with visa application</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <h2>How Long Does It Take?</h2>

        <p>Translation itself is quick—birth certificates are straightforward documents. Standard turnaround is 24-48 hours. Same-day and urgent service is available for visa appointment deadlines.</p>

        <p>The longer timeline is usually attestation, not translation. Plan attestation weeks in advance. Once that's done, translation can be completed in a day.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Birth certificate translation starts from AED 150 for MOJ-certified translation. The document is typically a single page, keeping costs reasonable. Urgent service carries a premium but is available when you need it.</p>
