const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Why did GDRFA reject my visa application?",
    answer: "GDRFA rejection notices are often generic, showing simply 'Rejected' with no specific reason. Common causes include missing documents, expired passports, incomplete attestation chains, untranslated or incorrectly translated documents, and name mismatches between your passport and supporting documents. You have 30 days to correct and resubmit."
  },
  {
    question: "Does GDRFA require Arabic translation of all documents?",
    answer: "Arabic translation by an MOJ-certified translator is expected for all foreign-language documents submitted to GDRFA. While some sources suggest English documents may be accepted in Dubai, typing centers and Amer centers consistently require Arabic translation. The safest approach is to submit MOJ-certified Arabic translations with every document."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I translate documents before or after attestation?",
    answer: "Always get attestation first, then translate. The Arabic translation must capture the attestation stamps and stickers on your document. If you translate first, the translation won't show the attestation markings, and you will need a new translation after attestation is complete."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the correct document sequence for a UAE visa?",
    answer: "The correct sequence is: (1) obtain original documents from your home country, (2) authenticate in your home country (apostille for Hague members, or notarization plus home MOFA plus UAE Embassy for non-Hague countries), (3) MOFA UAE attestation, (4) MOJ-certified Arabic translation, (5) typing center data entry, (6) GDRFA submission and review."
  },
  {
    question: "How long do I have to fix rejected visa documents?",
    answer: "GDRFA typically gives 30 days to submit missing or corrected documents. After this window, you may need to start the application process again, including paying new fees. If your application is rejected, act quickly to identify and correct the issue."
  },
  {
    question: "Can a typing center help fix my rejected visa application?",
    answer: "Typing centers handle data entry between you and the GDRFA system. They can resubmit corrected documents, but they cannot fix underlying issues with attestation or translation. If your document lacks MOJ certification or proper attestation, you need to resolve that before returning to the typing center."
  },
  {
    question: "What documents need attestation for a UAE family visa?",
    answer: "For a family/spouse visa, you typically need attested and translated birth certificates, marriage certificates, and sometimes police clearance certificates. Each document follows the same attestation chain: home country authentication, UAE Embassy attestation (or apostille for Hague members), then MOFA UAE attestation, then MOJ-certified Arabic translation."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to get visa documents translated for GDRFA?",
    answer: "MOJ-certified translation for standard visa documents starts at AED 150 per document. Complex documents or rare languages may cost more. We provide exact pricing after reviewing your documents. The cost of proper translation is far less than the cost of visa rejection, resubmission fees, and delays."

        <!-- Introduction -->
        <p class="lead-text">
          The General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA) processes hundreds of thousands of visa applications every year. When documents are incomplete, incorrectly attested, or improperly translated, the system flags them. You get a rejection notice. And the notice rarely tells you what went wrong.

        <p>
          This guide explains the document problems that cause GDRFA visa rejections in Dubai. We cover the correct <a href="/blog/uae-attestation-process-guide/">attestation and translation sequence</a>, the mistakes that trigger rejections, and how to fix each one before resubmitting.

        <!-- Section 1: How GDRFA Works -->
        <section id="how-gdrfa-works">
          <h2>How GDRFA Document Review Works</h2>

          <p>
            GDRFA uses an electronic review system. Your documents are uploaded through a typing center or the GDRFA app, not submitted in person to an officer. The system checks for completeness and compliance.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are approximately 600 approved typing centers in Dubai alone. These centers act as the interface between you and GDRFA. They enter your data, upload your documents, and submit your application. The <a href="/resources/visa-rejection-guide/">rejection notification</a> comes via SMS, email, and portal status update.
          </p>

          <h3>What the Rejection Notice Actually Says</h3>

          <p>
            Here is what catches most applicants off guard: GDRFA rejection notices are generic. The system typically shows "Rejected" without specifying whether the issue is a missing document, an attestation gap, a translation problem, or something else entirely.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some status codes exist. Code 021, for example, indicates an expiring passport. But most rejections show no code at all. You are told to resubmit within 30 days, without knowing what to fix.
          </p>

          <div class="callout-block">
            <strong>Why this matters:</strong> Because the rejection notice does not specify the problem, applicants often guess wrong, fix the wrong document, and get rejected again. Understanding the common failure points below prevents this cycle.
          </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 2: Correct Sequence -->
        <section id="correct-sequence">
          <h2>The Correct Document Sequence</h2>

          <p>
            Every visa document follows a six-step chain before GDRFA reviews it. Getting these steps out of order is one of the most common rejection causes.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Obtain the original document</strong> from your home country (birth certificate, marriage certificate, degree, police clearance)</li>
            <li><strong>Home country authentication.</strong> For <a href="/resources/attestation-guide/">Hague Convention member countries</a> (India, UK, USA, Philippines, Bangladesh, Canada): notarization followed by apostille. For non-Hague countries (Pakistan, Egypt): notarization, home country MOFA, then UAE Embassy in your home country.</li>
            <li><strong>UAE MOFA attestation.</strong> AED 150 per document, 1-3 working days, processed through the eDAS 2.0 system.</li>
            <li><strong>Arabic translation by MOJ-certified translator.</strong> This step must come after attestation. The translation needs to capture the attestation stamps and stickers on the document.</li>
            <li><strong>Typing center data entry.</strong> The typing center uploads your documents into the GDRFA system.</li>
            <li><strong>GDRFA review and decision.</strong> Electronic review. Entry permit arrives via email or SMS if approved.</li>
          </ol>

          <div class="callout-block warning">
            <strong>Critical sequencing rule:</strong> Translation must come AFTER attestation. If you translate first and then get the document attested, the translation will not show the attestation markings. GDRFA expects translated attestation stamps. You will need a new translation, which means paying twice.
          </div>

          <p>
            The GDRFA portal uses a general document upload system that accepts up to 10 documents per application. Documents are not uploaded to labeled fields (no separate "birth certificate" slot). This means the typing center's accuracy in organizing and labeling your documents matters.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 3: Five Mistakes -->
        <section id="five-mistakes">
          <h2>5 Document Mistakes That Cause Visa Rejections</h2>

          <h3>1. Wrong Attestation Chain</h3>

          <p>
            The <a href="/services/attestation/">attestation chain</a> differs depending on your home country's relationship with the Hague Convention. Getting this wrong is the most expensive mistake because it requires restarting from your home country.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Hague member countries</strong> (India, USA, UK, Philippines, Bangladesh, Canada): Your document needs notarization, then apostille from the relevant authority. The UAE accepts apostilles from these countries.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Hague countries</strong> (Pakistan, Egypt): Your document needs notarization, then authentication by your home country's MOFA, then attestation by the UAE Embassy in your country. This is a longer chain with more steps.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The UAE itself is <strong>not a Hague Convention member</strong>. Documents going from the UAE to other countries always require the full embassy attestation chain, regardless of the destination country's Hague status.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Missing or Incomplete Translation</h3>

          <p>
            <a href="/services/legal-translation/">MOJ-certified Arabic translation</a> is expected for all foreign-language documents. Common translation problems that trigger GDRFA rejections:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>No translation at all.</strong> Submitting documents only in English or another foreign language.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-MOJ translation.</strong> Using a certified translation from abroad (UK, Germany, or home country certified translators are not accepted). The translation must bear a UAE MOJ stamp.</li>
            <li><strong>Partial translation.</strong> Translating the main document but not the attestation stamps, notary seals, or handwritten annotations.</li>
            <li><strong>Translation before attestation.</strong> The translation does not reflect the attestation markings because it was done first.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3. Name Mismatches</h3>

          <p>
            This is especially common with <a href="/blog/marriage-certificate-translation-dubai/">marriage certificates</a> and <a href="/blog/birth-certificate-translation-uae-visa/">birth certificates</a>. If your name is transliterated differently on your passport versus your supporting documents, GDRFA may flag the discrepancy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Examples that cause problems:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Mohammed vs. Muhammad vs. Mohamed</li>
            <li>Surname differences between maiden name on birth certificate and married name on passport</li>
            <li>Father's name transliterated differently across documents</li>
            <li>Middle names present on one document but absent on another</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The MOJ-certified translator can add a clarifying note to the translation when name variations exist. This is not a guarantee of acceptance, but it addresses the discrepancy proactively.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Expired or Invalid Documents</h3>

          <p>
            Some documents have expiration windows that applicants overlook:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Passport validity:</strong> Must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the visa application date. Status code 021 flags this automatically.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="/personal/immigration/pcc/">Police clearance certificates:</a></strong> Many countries issue PCCs with 3-6 month validity. If yours has expired by the time GDRFA reviews your application, it will be rejected.</li>
            <li><strong>Medical fitness certificates:</strong> Valid for 60 days from the date of issue.</li>
            <li><strong>Residency of sponsor:</strong> Must have at least 1 month remaining.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>5. Missing Documents</h3>

          <p>
            The most straightforward rejection cause. Each visa category requires specific documents, and missing even one triggers rejection. The GDRFA system does not accept partial applications.
          </p>

          <p>
            Common omissions for family/spouse visas:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Marriage certificate (for spouse visa)</li>
            <li>Birth certificate (for child visa)</li>
            <li>Salary certificate or employment contract (proving sponsor income)</li>
            <li>Tenancy contract (proving adequate housing)</li>
            <li>Passport copies (sponsor and dependant)</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout-block">
            <strong>Practical tip:</strong> Before visiting the typing center, confirm your complete document checklist with the center directly. Requirements can vary by visa category and change periodically. The <a href="/resources/golden-visa-checklist/">Golden Visa checklist</a> has different requirements from a standard family visa.
          </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 4: Family Visa Checklist -->
        <section id="family-visa">
          <h2>Family Visa: The Document Checklist</h2>

          <p>
            Family and spouse visas are the most common GDRFA application type where document problems occur. Here is the typical document set:
          </p>

          <h3>For Spouse Visa</h3>

          <ol>
            <li>Sponsor's valid passport and visa copy</li>
            <li>Sponsor's Emirates ID (front and back)</li>
            <li>Sponsor's salary certificate or employment contract</li>
            <li>Sponsor's tenancy contract (Ejari registered in Dubai)</li>
            <li><a href="/blog/marriage-certificate-translation-dubai/">Marriage certificate</a> — attested and translated</li>
            <li>Spouse's passport copy (6+ months validity)</li>
            <li>Spouse's passport-size photos (white background)</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>For Child Visa</h3>

          <ol>
            <li>Sponsor's valid passport and visa copy</li>
            <li>Sponsor's Emirates ID (front and back)</li>
            <li>Sponsor's salary certificate</li>
            <li><a href="/blog/birth-certificate-translation-uae-visa/">Birth certificate</a> — attested and translated</li>
            <li>Child's passport copy</li>
            <li>Marriage certificate (to establish parental relationship)</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Each document marked "attested and translated" follows the six-step sequence described above. Attestation first, then MOJ-certified translation.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 5: How to Fix Rejection -->
        <section id="fix-rejection">
          <h2>How to Fix a Rejected Application</h2>

          <p>
            You have approximately 30 days from the rejection date to correct and resubmit. Here is the process:
          </p>

          <h3>Step 1: Identify the Problem</h3>

          <p>
            Since the rejection notice is generic, review your documents against the five mistake categories above. Check each document for:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Complete attestation chain (all stamps present)</li>
            <li>MOJ-certified Arabic translation (UAE MOJ stamp, not foreign certification)</li>
            <li>Name consistency across all documents</li>
            <li>Document validity dates</li>
            <li>Nothing missing from the required checklist</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Step 2: Fix the Specific Issue</h3>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Missing attestation:</strong> Get the document properly attested. For MOFA attestation, use the eDAS 2.0 system (1-3 working days, AED 150 per document).</li>
            <li><strong>Missing or incorrect translation:</strong> Get a new <a href="/services/legal-translation/">MOJ-certified translation</a> that captures all stamps and attestation markings.</li>
            <li><strong>Name mismatch:</strong> Request a translator's note clarifying the name variation. In some cases, a notarized affidavit of name equivalency from your home country may help.</li>
            <li><strong>Expired document:</strong> Obtain a fresh document and restart the attestation chain.</li>
            <li><strong>Missing document:</strong> Obtain and process the missing document through the full attestation-then-translation sequence.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Step 3: Resubmit Through the Typing Center</h3>

          <p>
            Return to the same typing center with your corrected documents. They will update your application in the GDRFA system. Resubmission fees may apply depending on the typing center.

          <h2>Preventing Rejection: Pre-Submission Check</h2>

          <p>
            Before visiting the typing center, run through this checklist:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Attestation chain complete?</strong> Every foreign document has the correct stamps for your country's Hague status. Check the <a href="/resources/attestation-guide/">attestation guide</a> for country-specific requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>MOFA stamp present?</strong> UAE MOFA attestation is the final step before translation.</li>
            <li><strong>MOJ-certified translation?</strong> Arabic translation bearing the UAE MOJ translator stamp. License number visible. Translation done after attestation.</li>
            <li><strong>Names match?</strong> Check every document against your passport. Flag any transliteration differences to your translator.</li>
            <li><strong>Documents current?</strong> Passport valid 6+ months. PCC within validity. Medical fitness within 60 days.</li>
            <li><strong>Nothing missing?</strong> Confirm the complete list with your typing center before your visit.</li>
          </ul>
