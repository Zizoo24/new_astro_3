        <div class="highlight-box">
          <p>UAE work permits are tied to specific job roles, not universal degree requirements. What qualifications MOHRE accepts depends on your profession, salary level, and the visa category your employer applies for. This guide explains what educational credentials work for different situations.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>How MOHRE Evaluates Qualifications</h2>

        <p>The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MOHRE) doesn't mandate a single minimum degree for all work permits. Instead, qualifications are evaluated against:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Job classification:</strong> Each occupation has expected qualification levels</li>
          <li><strong>Salary band:</strong> Higher salaries often correlate with higher qualification requirements</li>
          <li><strong>Visa category:</strong> Skilled worker visas have different requirements than general employment</li>
          <li><strong>Industry regulations:</strong> Healthcare, education, and engineering have specific requirements</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Bachelor's Degrees</h2>

        <p>A bachelor's degree is the most common qualification for professional roles in the UAE. MOHRE accepts bachelor's degrees from accredited universities worldwide.</p>

        <div class="degree-box bachelor">
          <h3><i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> Bachelor's Degree Requirements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>3-4 year undergraduate degree from accredited institution</li>
            <li>Full attestation chain (home country → UAE Embassy → MOFA)</li>
            <li><a href="/personal/academic/degree/">MOJ-certified Arabic translation</a></li>
            <li><a href="/personal/academic/transcripts/">Transcript translation</a> (sometimes required)</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="degree-note">Accepted for: Management, engineering, accounting, HR, marketing, IT, and most professional roles</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Common Bachelor's Degree Types</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>BA (Bachelor of Arts)</strong> — Humanities, social sciences, languages</li>
          <li><strong>BSc (Bachelor of Science)</strong> — Sciences, technology, mathematics</li>
          <li><strong>BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration)</strong> — Business and management</li>
          <li><strong>BEng (Bachelor of Engineering)</strong> — Engineering disciplines</li>
          <li><strong>LLB (Bachelor of Laws)</strong> — Legal profession</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Master's & Postgraduate Degrees</h2>

        <p>Master's degrees aren't required for most UAE work permits, but they enable certain opportunities:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Higher starting salaries in many organizations</li>
          <li>Qualification for senior positions</li>
          <li><a href="/services/golden-visa-translation/">Golden Visa professional category</a> (with AED 30K+ salary)</li>
          <li>Academic positions at UAE universities</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="degree-box master">
          <h3><i class="fas fa-user-graduate"></i> Master's Degree Requirements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1-2 year postgraduate degree from accredited institution</li>
            <li>Bachelor's degree as prerequisite (both may need translation)</li>
            <li>Full attestation chain</li>
            <li>MOJ-certified translation</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="degree-note">Types: MA, MSc, MBA, MEng, LLM, MPhil</p>

        <h3>Doctoral Degrees</h3>
        <p>PhD, DBA, and other doctoral degrees follow similar requirements. See our <a href="/blog/phd-dba-doctorate-translation-uae/">PhD and DBA translation guide</a> for detailed authority-specific requirements.</p>

        <h2>Diplomas & Associate Degrees</h2>

        <p>Diplomas and associate degrees are accepted for many positions in the UAE. These shorter programs (1-2 years) qualify holders for technical and skilled roles.</p>

        <div class="degree-box diploma">
          <h3><i class="fas fa-certificate"></i> Diploma Requirements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Certificate from accredited technical or vocational institution</li>
            <li>Full attestation chain</li>
            <li>MOJ-certified translation</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="degree-note">Accepted for: Technical roles, skilled trades, hospitality, healthcare support, administrative positions</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Higher National Diplomas (HND)</h3>
        <p>UK-style HNDs are well-recognized in the UAE due to historical ties. These two-year vocational qualifications are accepted for technical and supervisory roles.</p>

        <h2>Professional Certifications</h2>

        <p>Certain professional certifications can support or sometimes replace degree requirements for specific roles. The certification must be from a recognized professional body.</p>

        <div class="cert-grid">
          <div class="cert-card">
            <h4>Accounting & Finance</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>CPA (Certified Public Accountant)</li>

              <li>CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst)</li>
              <li>CMA (Certified Management Accountant)</li>

            </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
          <h4><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Professional Certificates Need Translation Too</h4>
          <p>Professional certifications require the same attestation and translation process as academic degrees. The issuing body must be recognized, and the certificate must be properly attested before translation.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Distance Education & Online Degrees</h2>

        <p>Online and distance learning degrees are accepted by MOHRE when they meet specific criteria. Not all online degrees qualify—accreditation matters significantly.</p>

        <h3>Accepted Online Degrees</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Degrees from universities with proper home-country accreditation</li>
          <li>Programs recognized by the country's education ministry</li>
          <li>Universities on the <a href="/resources/mohesr-equivalency/">MOHESR recognized institution list</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Potentially Rejected</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Degrees from unaccredited online-only institutions</li>
          <li>Programs from "diploma mills"</li>
          <li>Degrees not recognized in the issuing country</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Regulated Professions</h2>

        <p>Some professions have specific qualification requirements beyond standard MOHRE processing:</p>

        <div class="regulated-grid">
          <div class="regulated-card">
            <h4><i class="fas fa-hospital"></i> Healthcare</h4>
            <p>DHA, DOH, or MOH licensing required. <a href="/specialized/medical/dha-dataflow/">DataFlow verification</a> of all credentials mandatory.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="regulated-card">
            <h4><i class="fas fa-hard-hat"></i> Engineering</h4>
            <p>Society of Engineers registration for many roles. Degree must be from accredited engineering program.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="regulated-card">
            <h4><i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i> Education</h4>
            <p>KHDA or ADEK approval for teaching positions. Teaching certificate often required alongside degree.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="regulated-card">
            <h4><i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> Legal</h4>
            <p>MOJ registration required for legal practice. Law degree from recognized institution mandatory.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Translation Requirements Summary</h2>

        <p>Regardless of degree type, the translation requirements are consistent:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Attestation first:</strong> Complete the attestation chain in your home country</li>
          <li><strong>UAE attestation:</strong> UAE Embassy attestation (for most countries) + MOFA</li>
          <li><strong>Translation:</strong> <a href="/personal/academic/degree/">MOJ-certified Arabic translation</a></li>
          <li><strong>Supporting documents:</strong> <a href="/personal/academic/transcripts/">Transcripts</a> if employer requires</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Timeline Planning</h3>
          <p>Allow 2-4 weeks for attestation and translation. If you need <a href="/resources/mohesr-equivalency/">MOHESR equivalency</a> (for government jobs or Golden Visa), add another 2-3 weeks. Start the process before your job offer confirmation to avoid delays.</p>
        </div>
