          <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Many clients overpay for legal translation by requesting MOJ certification when certified translation would suffice. Understanding the difference can save you 50% on costs. This guide explains exactly what you need and what you'll pay.
        </div>

        <h2>Legal Translation Pricing in Dubai: The Real Picture</h2>

        <p>If you've searched for legal translation costs in Dubai, you've probably found a confusing range of prices. Some typing centers advertise AED 35 per page. Professional services quote AED 150 or more. <strong>Both prices are real</strong>—but they're for very different services with very different outcomes.</p>

        <p>The price you pay depends on several factors. What certification level do you actually need? How complex is your document? How quickly do you need it? And critically—will the translation be accepted where you need to submit it? A cheap translation that gets rejected by Dubai Courts costs you far more than getting it right the first time.</p>

        <h3>Understanding the Two Types of Legal Translation</h3>

        <p>Before discussing prices, you need to understand what you're buying. Dubai has two main categories of legal translation, and many clients don't know the difference until they've already paid for the wrong one.</p>

        <p><strong>MOJ-Certified Translation</strong> is performed by translators registered with the UAE Ministry of Justice. These translations carry an official stamp and signature that UAE courts, ministries, and government agencies require. You need MOJ certification for <a href="/legal/litigation/">court submissions</a>, government applications, and official legal proceedings.</p>

        <p><strong>Certified Translation</strong> is performed by qualified translators who certify their work's accuracy but aren't MOJ-registered. These translations are accepted by banks, employers, private companies, and many international bodies. They cost less than MOJ translations because they serve different purposes.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
          <h4>The Most Common Mistake</h4>
          <p>Requesting MOJ-certified translation when you only need certified translation. If you're submitting documents to your employer, bank, or a private company, certified translation is usually sufficient—and costs significantly less.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Current Pricing in Dubai (2026)</h2>

        <p>Here's what legal translation actually costs in Dubai as of January 2026. These are real market rates, not promotional prices or bait-and-switch quotes.</p>

        <h3>MOJ-Certified Translation</h3>

        <p>Starting from AED 150 per page for standard documents. This covers birth certificates, marriage certificates, and straightforward contracts. Final pricing depends on document complexity—a simple power of attorney costs less than a detailed commercial contract with technical terminology.</p>

        <p>Complex legal documents—litigation files, arbitration awards, detailed corporate agreements—are priced based on content. A 50-page court bundle with technical terminology costs more per page than a single-page birth certificate. This is standard across professional translation services.</p>

        <h3>Certified Translation</h3>

        <p>Starting from AED 150 per page for documents that don't require MOJ certification. HR documents, bank submissions, and private company requirements typically fall into this category. The process is similar but without MOJ registration requirements.</p>

        <h3>Urgent and Same-Day Service</h3>

        <p>Need translation within 24 hours? Expect a 30-50% premium over standard rates. Same-day delivery for court deadlines commands the highest premiums. This reflects the priority handling required—your document jumps the queue and receives immediate attention.</p>

        <p>Our VIP Concierge service delivers digital drafts within 60 minutes for genuine emergencies. This premium service exists because <a href="/legal/litigation/">court filing deadlines</a> don't negotiate—missing them costs far more than urgent translation fees.</p>

        <h2>What Affects Your Final Price?</h2>

        <p>When you request a quote, these factors determine your final cost. Understanding them helps you provide accurate information upfront and avoid quote adjustments later.</p>

        <h3>1. Certification Level Required</h3>

        <p>The single biggest factor. Ask yourself: where will this document be submitted? Government agencies and courts require MOJ certification. Private companies usually accept certified translation. A lawyer or PRO can advise if you're unsure.</p>

        <h3>2. Document Type and Complexity</h3>

        <p>A birth certificate is straightforward—standard format, predictable content. A <a href="/legal/contracts/spa/">sale and purchase agreement</a> is complex—negotiated terms, technical language, legal nuances. Complex documents require more time and expertise, affecting price.</p>

        <h3>3. Language Pair</h3>

        <p>Arabic to English and English to Arabic are standard in Dubai. Less common languages may cost more due to limited translator availability. Most legal translation in Dubai involves Arabic-English pairs.</p>

        <h3>4. Page Count and Volume</h3>

        <p>More pages mean more work. However, volume discounts often apply to larger projects—a 100-page litigation bundle may have a lower per-page rate than a single document. Ask about volume pricing for significant projects.</p>

        <h3>5. Turnaround Time</h3>

        <p>Standard turnaround (48-72 hours) carries standard pricing. Same-day and urgent service costs more. If you can plan ahead, standard turnaround offers the best value.</p>

        <h3>6. Additional Services</h3>

        <p>Need attestation after translation? <a href="/services/attestation/mofa/">MOFA attestation</a> and embassy legalization are separate services with separate fees. Some providers bundle these services; others quote separately. Clarify upfront what's included.</p>

        <h2>How to Avoid Overpaying</h2>

        <p>Here's practical advice to ensure you pay fairly for what you actually need.</p>

        <h3>Get the Right Certification Level</h3>

        <p>Before requesting translation, confirm what certification you need. Contact the receiving organization—court, bank, employer, agency—and ask specifically what they require. Many clients request MOJ certification "to be safe" when it's not required, paying more than necessary.</p>

        <h3>Provide Complete Documents</h3>

        <p>Incomplete or unclear documents require follow-up, which delays translation and may affect pricing. Send complete, legible documents with any context that helps the translator understand technical terms.</p>

        <h3>Plan Ahead When Possible</h3>

        <p>Urgent fees are avoidable with planning. If you know you'll need translation for a court filing, don't wait until the day before the deadline. Standard turnaround saves money and gives you time to review the translation.</p>

        <h3>Ask About Package Deals</h3>

        <p>Need translation plus attestation? Ask about bundled services. If you have multiple documents, ask about volume pricing. Providers often offer better rates for comprehensive projects.</p>

        <h3>Verify What's Included</h3>

        <p>A quote should specify: what's included (translation, certification, stamps), delivery format (digital, hard copy), and any additional fees. Clarify before accepting to avoid surprises.</p>

        <h2>Comparing Providers: What to Consider</h2>

        <p>Dubai has hundreds of translation providers—from typing centers to professional services. Price alone doesn't tell the full story.</p>

        <h3>Court Acceptance</h3>

        <p>The cheapest translation that gets rejected costs more than a professional translation accepted first time. For court documents, ask if the provider's translations are regularly accepted by Dubai Courts. Request references if needed.</p>

        <h3>Turnaround Reliability</h3>

        <p>Missing a court deadline because translation was late is catastrophic. Established providers have systems to meet deadlines consistently. Ask about their track record and what happens if they miss a deadline.</p>

        <h3>Communication and Support</h3>

        <p>Can you reach them quickly when you have questions? Do they explain what you actually need versus just accepting whatever you request? Our <a href="/contact/">WhatsApp-first approach</a> means you get responses within minutes, not days.</p>

        <h3>Specialization</h3>

        <p>Legal translation requires specific expertise. A translator who handles everything from menus to medical reports may not have the legal terminology knowledge that court documents require. Ask about their legal translation experience.</p>

        <h2>Real Cost Examples</h2>

        <p>To make pricing concrete, here are typical scenarios and what they cost.</p>

        <h3>Personal Documents for Employment</h3>

        <p>Scenario: You need your degree certificate and marriage certificate translated for a new employer. The employer (a private company) accepts certified translation.</p>

        <p>Cost estimate: AED 150-300 for both documents with certified translation. No MOJ certification needed. Standard 48-hour turnaround.</p>

        <h3>Court Submission Package</h3>

        <p>Scenario: You need a 20-page contract and supporting documents translated for Dubai Courts. MOJ certification required. Filing deadline in one week.</p>

        <p>Cost estimate: Starting from AED 3,000+ depending on document complexity. MOJ certification required. Standard turnaround sufficient with one week notice.</p>

        <h3>Urgent Power of Attorney</h3>

        <p>Scenario: You need a <a href="/legal/corporate/poa/">power of attorney</a> translated for urgent banking matter. MOJ certification required. Same-day delivery needed.</p>

        <p>Cost estimate: Starting from AED 225+ with urgent premium. MOJ certification. Same-day delivery adds 50% to standard rate.</p>

        <h2>Getting an Accurate Quote</h2>

        <p>To receive a precise quote rather than a range, provide the following information.</p>

        <p><strong>Document type</strong>—contract, certificate, court document, etc. This determines complexity.</p>

        <p><strong>Page count</strong>—or send the document itself for accurate assessment.</p>

        <p><strong>Intended use</strong>—where will you submit it? This determines certification level.</p>

        <p><strong>Deadline</strong>—when do you need the completed translation?</p>

        <p><strong>Language direction</strong>—Arabic to English, English to Arabic, or both.</p>

        <p>Send your document via WhatsApp with these details, and you'll receive a specific quote—not a vague range—within minutes.</p>
