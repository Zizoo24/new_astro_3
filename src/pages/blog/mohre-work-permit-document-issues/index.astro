        <p class="lead-text">A MOHRE work permit rejection delays your start date, costs your employer money, and adds weeks to the visa timeline. Most rejections trace back to document problems that could have been caught early. This guide covers the specific issues we see repeatedly and how to prevent them.</p>

        <div class="callout-block">
          <i class="fas fa-file-alt callout-block__icon"></i>
          <div class="callout-block__content">
            <p><strong>Key Fact:</strong> MOHRE requires every foreign-language document to carry an MOJ-certified Arabic translation. Translations without the Ministry of Justice stamp are rejected automatically, regardless of accuracy.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>How MOHRE Document Review Works</h2>

        <p>The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation reviews every work permit application in two stages. First, the system checks that all required documents are present and formatted correctly. Second, a reviewer verifies attestation chains, translation certification, and job-qualification alignment.</p>

        <p>Rejection at either stage sends the application back to the employer. The employer then contacts the employee, who must correct the problem and resubmit. Each cycle adds 1-4 weeks to the timeline.</p>

        <p>Understanding what MOHRE checks helps you prepare documents correctly the first time.</p>

        <h2>Translation-Related Rejection Reasons</h2>

        <p>Translation problems account for a significant share of MOHRE rejections. These errors are preventable with proper preparation.</p>

        <h3>Missing MOJ Certification</h3>

        <p>MOHRE only accepts translations that carry an MOJ-registered translator's stamp, signature, and license number. A translation from an uncertified source, no matter how accurate, will be rejected.</p>

        <p>Common mistakes include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Using a freelance translator without MOJ registration</li>
          <li>Submitting translations from the home country instead of UAE-certified ones</li>
          <li>Presenting translations stamped by an expired license</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Our translations are executed through Arkan Legal Translation, MOJ License #701. You can verify this license by calling 800 333333.</p>

        <h3>Name Discrepancies Between Documents</h3>

        <p>MOHRE compares the name on your <a href="/personal/academic/degree/">degree certificate</a> against your passport, contract, and other submissions. Even minor variations cause problems. Transliteration from non-Latin scripts creates the most issues.</p>

        <p>Examples that trigger rejection:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>"Mohammed" on the passport vs "Muhammad" on the translated degree</li>
          <li>Missing middle name in the translation</li>
          <li>Different family name spellings across documents</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A skilled translator matches name transliterations to your passport exactly. This prevents the mismatch before it reaches MOHRE.</p>

        <h3>Incomplete or Inaccurate Translations</h3>

        <p>MOHRE reviewers compare translations against the original documents. Missing sections, omitted seals, or untranslated stamps raise flags. Every element on the original must appear in the Arabic translation.</p>

        <p>This includes university seals, registrar signatures, date formats, and any annotations or addenda on the original document.</p>

        <h2>Attestation Problems</h2>

        <p>Attestation errors are the most time-consuming to fix because correction often requires sending documents back to the issuing country.</p>

        <h3>Broken Attestation Chain</h3>

        <p>MOHRE requires a complete <a href="/services/attestation/">attestation chain</a> for foreign documents. The exact steps depend on the issuing country. For most countries, the chain follows this order:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Home country authentication</strong> -- Notarization or apostille from the issuing authority</li>
          <li><strong>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</strong> -- Home country MOFA attestation</li>
          <li><strong>UAE Embassy</strong> -- Legalization in the home country</li>
          <li><strong>UAE MOFA</strong> -- Final attestation stamp in the UAE</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Skipping any step invalidates the entire chain. The most common gap is missing the UAE Embassy step, which requires the physical document to be in the home country.</p>

        <div class="callout-block callout-block--light">
          <i class="fas fa-globe callout-block__icon"></i>
          <div class="callout-block__content">
            <p><strong>Hague Convention Note:</strong> Countries like India, UK, USA, Canada, and the Philippines are Hague members and use apostilles. However, the UAE is not a Hague member. Documents from Hague countries still need UAE Embassy legalization and MOFA attestation for MOHRE acceptance.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Expired Attestation</h3>

        <p>Some attestation stamps carry validity periods. Documents attested years ago may need re-attestation, especially if the issuing authority has changed its processes. MOHRE reviewers check attestation dates against current requirements.</p>

        <h3>Wrong Attestation Type</h3>

        <p>Different documents require different attestation paths. An <a href="/resources/indian-documents-uae-guide/">Indian degree</a> follows a different attestation process than an Indian experience certificate. Using the wrong path means starting over.</p>

        <h2>Academic Document Issues</h2>

        <p>Degrees and academic records are the most scrutinized documents in the work permit application. MOHRE verifies that your qualifications match the position.</p>

        <h3>Degree Does Not Match Job Title</h3>

        <p>MOHRE checks whether your educational background supports the job title on the employment contract. Mismatches trigger rejection or visa category downgrade.</p>

        <p>Common mismatch scenarios:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Applying as "Electrical Engineer" with a Commerce degree</li>
          <li>Applying as "Accountant" with an Arts degree</li>
          <li>"IT Manager" position with a non-technical qualification</li>
          <li>"Teacher" designation without an Education degree or teaching certificate</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The solution depends on the situation. Sometimes the employer adjusts the job title. Other times, you can submit additional <a href="/personal/academic/transcripts/">transcripts</a> showing relevant coursework or professional certifications that bridge the gap.</p>

        <h3>Unrecognized Institutions</h3>

        <p>MOHRE may reject degrees from institutions not recognized by the home country's education ministry. Distance learning degrees and online programs from unaccredited bodies face particular scrutiny.</p>

        <p>Before starting the work permit process, verify your university's accreditation status with the relevant education authority in your home country.</p>

        <h3>Missing Transcripts</h3>

        <p>For certain professions, MOHRE requests <a href="/personal/academic/transcripts/">academic transcripts</a> in addition to the degree certificate. This is common for engineering, healthcare, and education roles where specific subjects must appear in the academic record.</p>

        <p>Transcripts require the same attestation and <a href="/personal/academic/transcripts/">MOJ-certified translation</a> as the degree itself.</p>

        <h2>Employment Contract Problems</h2>

        <p>The employment contract is a core document in the work permit application. MOHRE examines it closely for compliance.</p>

        <h3>Contract Language Issues</h3>

        <p>MOHRE requires the employment <a href="/legal/contracts/">contract</a> to be in Arabic or accompanied by an MOJ-certified Arabic translation. Contracts drafted only in English are not accepted.</p>

        <p>The translation must match the English version exactly. Discrepancies between the Arabic and English versions create legal ambiguity that MOHRE will not approve.</p>

        <h3>Missing Mandatory Clauses</h3>

        <p>UAE labor law requires specific clauses in every employment contract. Missing elements lead to rejection:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Job title and description</li>
          <li>Salary and benefits breakdown</li>
          <li>Contract duration (limited or unlimited)</li>
          <li>Probation period terms</li>
          <li>Working hours and leave entitlement</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The <a href="/resources/moj-vs-certified/">difference between MOJ and certified translation</a> matters here. MOHRE requires the MOJ-certified version for contract submissions.</p>

        <h2>Profession-Specific Requirements</h2>

        <p>Regulated professions have additional document requirements beyond the standard work permit package.</p>

        <h3>Healthcare Professionals</h3>

        <p>Doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and allied health workers need licensing from DHA (Dubai), DOH (Abu Dhabi), or MOH (federal). This includes <a href="/specialized/medical/dha-dataflow/">DataFlow verification</a> of all credentials.</p>

        <p>Required documents include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Medical degree with attestation and MOJ translation</li>
          <li>Professional license from the home country</li>
          <li>Good standing certificate from last employer</li>
          <li>Specialist certificates (if applicable)</li>
          <li>BLS/ACLS certifications for clinical roles</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All documents require MOJ-certified translation. The <a href="/specialized/medical/dha-dataflow/">DHA DataFlow process</a> verifies originals independently, so any discrepancy between your documents and university records will surface.</p>

        <h3>Engineers</h3>

        <p>Engineering positions often require registration with the UAE Society of Engineers. The degree must be from an accredited engineering program. MOHRE cross-references the degree specialization against the job title.</p>

        <p>A Civil Engineering degree supports a "Civil Engineer" job title. It does not automatically support "Electrical Engineer" or "Mechanical Engineer." The specialization must align.</p>

        <h3>Educators</h3>

        <p>Teaching positions require KHDA approval in Dubai or ADEK approval in Abu Dhabi. Beyond the degree, teachers typically need:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Teaching certificate or diploma in education</li>
          <li>Home country teaching <a href="/personal/immigration/license/">license translation</a></li>
          <li>Police clearance certificate</li>
          <li>Experience letters from previous schools</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Legal Professionals</h3>

        <p>Lawyers and legal consultants need MOJ registration. The law degree must come from a recognized institution, and the specialization must match the practice area.</p>

        <h2>How to Prevent Work Permit Document Rejections</h2>

        <p>Prevention is faster and cheaper than correction. Follow these steps before your employer submits the application.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Audit Your Documents Early</h3>

        <p>Collect all required documents at least 4 weeks before your expected start date. Check for completeness, legibility, and consistency across all papers.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Verify Name Consistency</h3>

        <p>Compare the name spelling on your passport against every other document. Flag any variations before translation begins. Your translator should match the passport transliteration exactly.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Complete Attestation First</h3>

        <p>Finish the entire <a href="/services/attestation/">attestation chain</a> before requesting translation. The translator needs to capture attestation stamps and seals in the Arabic version.</p>

        <h3>Step 4: Use MOJ-Certified Translation</h3>

        <p>Submit your attested documents for <a href="/personal/academic/degree/">MOJ-certified translation</a>. Confirm that the translator's license is current. Ask for verification details if needed.</p>

        <h3>Step 5: Cross-Check Job Title Alignment</h3>

        <p>Review the job title on your employment contract against your degree. If there is a mismatch, discuss it with your employer before submission. Adjusting the title at this stage is far simpler than after rejection.</p>

        <h3>Step 6: Prepare Profession-Specific Documents</h3>

        <p>If you work in healthcare, engineering, education, or law, gather the additional documents your regulatory body requires. Start the licensing process early, as it runs parallel to the work permit application.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>What to Do After a Rejection</h2>

        <p>If MOHRE has already rejected your application, act quickly. The employer has a limited window to resubmit.</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Read the rejection notice carefully.</strong> MOHRE specifies the exact reason. Focus on what they flagged, not on guessing.</li>
          <li><strong>Gather the correct documents.</strong> If attestation is incomplete, start the process immediately. If translation is the issue, get MOJ-certified translation done urgently.</li>
          <li><strong>Coordinate with your employer's PRO.</strong> The PRO handles the resubmission. Provide corrected documents promptly so they can resubmit within the allowed timeframe.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep copies of everything.</strong> Maintain a complete file of originals, translations, and attestation records for reference.</li>
        </ol>
