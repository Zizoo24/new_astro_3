const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Why was my MOHRE work permit application rejected?",
    answer: "The most common reasons are missing documents, expired passport or visa, unclear or unattested academic certificates, job offers that contradict UAE labor law, company violations or quota exceedance, and mismatches between your occupation and the company's licensed business activities. MOHRE's Nawakas system identifies specific missing items."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the MOHRE Nawakas process?",
    answer: "Nawakas (meaning 'missing' in Arabic) is MOHRE's dedicated process for handling deficient applications. When your application is flagged for missing or incorrect documents, you receive a notification identifying what needs to be corrected. You can submit the missing documentation through Tasheel service centers."
  },
  {
    question: "Does MOHRE accept certified translations from my home country?",
    answer: "No. MOHRE requires MOJ-certified Arabic translation bearing a UAE Ministry of Justice translator stamp. Certified translations from other countries (UK sworn translators, German vereidigte, Indian notarized) are not accepted. The translation must be done by a UAE MOJ-licensed translator."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need MOHESR equivalency for my degree?",
    answer: "It depends on your profession. MOHESR equivalency (now called Certificate of Recognition) is mandatory for healthcare, engineering, teaching, government roles, law, and Golden Visa applications. It is generally not required for private-sector roles unless your employer specifically demands it. Graduates of CAA-licensed UAE universities are also exempt."
  },
  {
    question: "What documents does the employee need for a UAE work permit?",
    answer: "Employees typically need: passport (6+ months validity), passport photos, educational certificates (attested and translated), professional certificates if applicable, experience letters, Emirates ID application, medical fitness certificate, and any profession-specific licenses. The exact list depends on your occupation category and employer's trade license."
  },
  {
    question: "How does MOHRE's AI document verification work?",
    answer: "Since October 2025, MOHRE uses the 'Eye' AI system powered by Regula OCR and Azure AI Vision for automated document verification. The system checks document authenticity, completeness, and compliance in the first pass. Only flagged exceptions go to human review. This means common errors like unclear scans or missing stamps are caught faster than before."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the MOHRE employment contract language requirement?",
    answer: "MOHRE standard employment contracts must be in Arabic and English (dual language). Since January 2016, contracts may also include a third language the worker understands: Bengali, Chinese, Dari, Hindi, Malayalam, Nepalese, Sinhalese, Tamil, or Urdu. Job offers must be in Arabic, English, and a language the worker understands."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to translate work permit documents?",
    answer: "MOJ-certified translation for standard employment documents starts at AED 150 per document. Degree certificates, experience letters, and professional licenses each count as separate documents. We provide exact pricing after reviewing your documents via WhatsApp. The cost of proper translation is minimal compared to the delays caused by rejection."

        <!-- Introduction -->
        <p class="lead-text">
          Every guide about MOHRE work permits is written for employers and HR departments. Nobody writes for the employee who just received a rejection and needs to fix it. If your employer's PRO tells you "there's a problem with your documents," this guide explains what that means and what to do next.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MOHRE) processes work permits through Tasheel service centers and the <a href="/blog/degrees-accepted-uae-work-permit/">approved employer portal</a>. Since October 2025, MOHRE uses an AI-powered verification system called "Eye" to screen documents automatically before human review.

        <!-- Section 1: How MOHRE Reviews -->
        <section id="how-mohre-reviews">
          <h2>How MOHRE Reviews Your Documents</h2>

          <p>
            MOHRE applications go through Tasheel service centers, where documents are uploaded into the system. Since October 2025, the "Eye" AI system performs the initial verification.
          </p>

          <h3>The "Eye" AI Verification System</h3>

          <p>
            Launched at GITEX Global 2025, the Eye system uses Regula OCR and Azure AI Vision to check documents automatically. It verifies:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Document authenticity:</strong> Are the stamps, signatures, and seals genuine?</li>
            <li><strong>Completeness:</strong> Are all required documents present?</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Do documents meet MOHRE requirements?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Hard blocks stop applications immediately. A passport with less than 6 months validity or a residency visa with less than 1 month remaining will not proceed past the first screen.
          </p>

          <h3>What Happens When Documents Are Missing</h3>

          <p>
            MOHRE uses a process called "Nawakas" (Arabic for "missing") to handle deficient applications. Unlike <a href="/blog/gdrfa-visa-document-problems/">GDRFA's generic rejection notices</a>, MOHRE's system is more specific. It identifies what is missing and provides a transaction tracking number.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can submit corrected documents through a dedicated Tasheel counter. The window for correction depends on the specific issue, so act quickly.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 2: Common Rejections -->
        <section id="common-rejections">
          <h2>6 Document Problems That Cause Rejections</h2>

          <h3>1. Missing Documents</h3>

          <p>
            The most frequent rejection cause. MOHRE requires a specific set of documents per occupation category. Missing even one triggers the Nawakas process. Common omissions:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Academic certificates (degree, diploma, or professional qualification)</li>
            <li>Experience letters from previous employers</li>
            <li>Professional licenses for regulated occupations (healthcare, engineering, education)</li>
            <li>Medical fitness certificate</li>
            <li>Passport-size photographs (white background)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2. Expired Passports or Visas</h3>

          <p>
            The Eye system blocks these automatically:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Passport:</strong> Must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the application date</li>
            <li><strong>Existing visa:</strong> Must have at least 1 month remaining</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If your passport expires within 6 months, renew it before starting the work permit process. Renewing after submission means restarting the application.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Unclear or Unattested Academic Certificates</h3>

          <p>
            Your <a href="/blog/degree-certificate-translation-dubai/">degree certificate</a> needs to be properly attested before MOHRE accepts it. The <a href="/blog/uae-attestation-process-guide/">attestation chain</a> depends on your home country's Hague Convention status:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Hague countries</strong> (India, UK, USA, Philippines, Bangladesh, Canada): Notarization, then apostille, then MOJ-certified Arabic translation</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Hague countries</strong> (Pakistan, Egypt): Notarization, home MOFA, UAE Embassy, UAE MOFA, then MOJ-certified Arabic translation</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The UAE is <strong>not a Hague Convention member</strong>. This fact does not change the requirement for incoming documents, which still follow the Hague/non-Hague pathway based on the issuing country.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Job Offer Contradictions</h3>

          <p>
            MOHRE checks that your job offer aligns with UAE labor law. Issues that trigger rejection:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Job title does not match your qualifications</li>
            <li>Salary below minimum thresholds for the occupation</li>
            <li>Occupation code does not match the employer's trade license activities</li>
            <li>Contract terms violating Federal Decree-Law No. 33 of 2021 (UAE Labour Law)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            These are employer-side issues. If your work permit is rejected for job offer reasons, your employer's PRO needs to correct the application.
          </p>

          <h3>5. Company Violations or Quota Issues</h3>

          <p>
            Sometimes the rejection has nothing to do with your documents. MOHRE blocks new work permits when:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>The employer has outstanding labor violations</li>
            <li>The company has exceeded its Emiratisation quota</li>
            <li>The employer's trade license is expired or suspended</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Your employer must resolve these issues before resubmitting. There is nothing an employee can fix on their end for these rejections.
          </p>

          <h3>6. Translation Issues</h3>

          <p>
            Documents submitted without <a href="/services/legal-translation/">MOJ-certified Arabic translation</a> get rejected. Specific problems:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>No translation:</strong> Submitting documents only in English or another language</li>
            <li><strong>Foreign certification:</strong> Using a certified translation from your home country. MOHRE requires a UAE MOJ stamp, not a UK sworn translation or Indian notarized translation.</li>
            <li><strong>Translation before attestation:</strong> The same sequencing issue as <a href="/blog/gdrfa-visa-document-problems/">GDRFA applications</a>. Translate after attestation so the translation captures all stamps.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 3: Degree Issues -->
        <section id="degree-issues">
          <h2>Degree and Academic Certificate Issues</h2>

          <p>
            Academic documents cause a disproportionate number of work permit rejections. Here are the specific problems:
          </p>

          <h3>Unrecognized Universities</h3>

          <p>
            Accreditation in your home country does not guarantee recognition in the UAE. A university accredited by India's UGC or Pakistan's HEC may not be on <a href="/resources/mohesr-equivalency/">MOHESR's recognized list</a>. If MOHRE flags your university, you may need to go through the MOHESR equivalency process (now called "Certificate of Recognition") before the work permit can proceed.
          </p>

          <h3>Distance Learning and Online Degrees</h3>

          <p>
            MOHESR's 2023 policy permits some distance learning degrees if the institution is accredited. However, online degrees in medicine, engineering, and law are categorically rejected. If your degree was earned through distance learning, check with MOHESR before assuming it will be accepted.
          </p>

          <h3>Name Discrepancies</h3>

          <p>
            Even minor transliteration differences between your passport name and your degree certificate trigger rejection. Mohammad on the passport but Mohammed on the degree? That is enough.
          </p>

          <p>
            The translator can add a clarifying note, but prevention is better: when issuing new academic documents, ensure the name spelling matches your passport exactly.
          </p>

          <div class="callout-block">
            <strong>MOHESR's 7-day deadline:</strong> If MOHESR requests additional documentation during the equivalency process, you have 7 days to respond. Missing this deadline results in automatic rejection with no refund of the application fee. Set a calendar reminder the day you submit.
          </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 4: Translation Requirements -->
        <section id="translation-requirements">
          <h2>Translation Requirements for Work Permits</h2>

          <h3>What Needs Translation</h3>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Academic certificates:</strong> Degree, diploma, or professional qualification</li>
            <li><strong>Experience letters:</strong> From previous employers confirming your work history</li>
            <li><strong>Professional licenses:</strong> For regulated professions (medical, engineering, teaching)</li>
            <li><strong>Police clearance certificates:</strong> If required for your occupation category</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What Does Not Need Translation</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Passport (already bilingual or in English)</li>
            <li>Emirates ID (issued bilingually by ICP)</li>
            <li>Medical fitness certificate (issued bilingually in the UAE)</li>
            <li>Documents already in Arabic</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The Employment Contract</h3>

          <p>
            MOHRE's standard employment contract is a dual-language document (Arabic and English). Since January 2016, it may include a third language that the worker understands. Approved additional languages include Bengali, Chinese, Dari, Hindi, Malayalam, Nepalese, Sinhalese, Tamil, and Urdu.
          </p>

          <p>
            The job offer itself must be in Arabic, English, and a language the worker understands. This is a legal requirement under MOHRE policy, not optional.
          </p>

          <div class="callout-block warning">
            <strong>Arabic controls in disputes:</strong> Under Federal Decree-Law No. 33 of 2021, the Arabic version of the employment contract controls if there is a dispute between the Arabic and English text. Make sure both versions say the same thing before you sign.
          </div>

        <!-- Section 5: Fix Rejection -->
        <section id="fix-rejection">
          <h2>How to Fix a Rejected Work Permit</h2>

          <h3>Step 1: Identify Whether It Is Your Issue or the Employer's</h3>

          <p>
            Ask your employer's PRO for the specific rejection reason from the Nawakas system. If it involves:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Your documents</strong> (missing, expired, unattested, untranslated): You need to fix these.</li>
            <li><strong>The job offer or company status</strong> (quota, violations, occupation mismatch): Your employer needs to fix these.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Step 2: Fix Your Documents</h3>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Missing attestation:</strong> Start the attestation chain. Allow 1-2 weeks for MOFA attestation through eDAS 2.0.</li>
            <li><strong>Missing translation:</strong> Get <a href="/services/legal-translation/">MOJ-certified Arabic translation</a> after attestation is complete.</li>
            <li><strong>Unrecognized degree:</strong> Apply for <a href="/resources/mohesr-equivalency/">MOHESR Certificate of Recognition</a>. Allow 2-6 weeks.</li>
            <li><strong>Name mismatch:</strong> Request a translator's clarifying note. Consider a notarized name equivalency affidavit from your home country for significant differences.</li>
            <li><strong>Expired documents:</strong> Obtain fresh copies and restart the attestation-translation sequence.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Step 3: Resubmit Through Tasheel</h3>

          <p>
            Your employer or their PRO submits the corrected documents through the same Tasheel service center. The Nawakas tracking number connects your correction to the original application.

          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Passport:</strong> Valid for 6+ months. Clear scan of all pages with stamps.</li>
            <li><strong>Passport photos:</strong> White background. Recent. Matches passport appearance.</li>
            <li><strong>Academic certificate:</strong> Attested through the correct chain for your country. <a href="/blog/uae-attestation-process-guide/">MOJ-certified Arabic translation</a> completed after attestation.</li>
            <li><strong>Experience letters:</strong> From each employer listed in your CV. Attested and translated if from a foreign employer.</li>
            <li><strong>Professional license:</strong> If your occupation is regulated (healthcare, engineering, teaching). Attested and translated.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="/personal/immigration/pcc/">Police clearance certificate:</a></strong> Within validity period. Attested and translated.</li>
