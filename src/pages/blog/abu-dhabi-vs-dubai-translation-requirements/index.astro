    question: "Do Abu Dhabi courts accept the same translations as Dubai Courts?",
    answer: "Not always. ADJD (Abu Dhabi Judicial Department) and Dubai Courts both require MOJ-certified Arabic translation. However, ADJD has specific formatting and copy requirements that differ from Dubai Courts. Always confirm which court system will receive your documents."
  },
  {
    question: "What is ADJD Circular 8/2023?",
    answer: "ADJD Circular 8/2023 allows Abu Dhabi judges to accept untranslated bank statements and invoices when the content is primarily numerical. This is a notable exception to the general Arabic translation requirement. Dubai Courts have not adopted the same policy."
  },
  {
    question: "Is ADGM the same as DIFC for translation purposes?",
    answer: "Both operate in English under common law. However, ADGM sits under Abu Dhabi jurisdiction for enforcement, while DIFC sits under Dubai. If your ADGM judgment needs enforcement against mainland Abu Dhabi assets, it goes through ADJD procedures, not Dubai Courts."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need MOJ translation for DHA or DOH licensing?",
    answer: "DHA (Dubai Health Authority) and DOH (Department of Health Abu Dhabi) both require certified translation for foreign credentials. DHA uses the DataFlow verification process. DOH has its own equivalency evaluation. Check with the relevant authority before submitting."
  },
  {
    question: "Can a translator licensed in Dubai translate for Abu Dhabi submissions?",
    answer: "Yes. MOJ translation licenses are federal, not emirate-specific. A licensed MOJ translator can certify documents for submission anywhere in the UAE, including Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, and all other emirates."
  },
  {
    question: "Are real estate translation requirements different between Abu Dhabi and Dubai?",
    answer: "Yes. Dubai Land Department (DLD) has established procedures and standard forms. Abu Dhabi municipalities handle property registration differently, with varying requirements across Abu Dhabi City, Al Ain, and Al Dhafra. Always verify with the specific municipality."
  },
  {
    question: "Which emirate has stricter translation requirements?",
    answer: "Neither is universally stricter. ADJD requires more certified copies per filing than Dubai Courts. Dubai Courts tend to be more rigid on formatting. Both require MOJ-certified translation. The differences are procedural, not about quality standards."

        <section id="courts">
          <h2>Courts: ADJD vs Dubai Courts</h2>

          <p>
            Both court systems require MOJ-certified Arabic translation. The Federal MOJ license is valid across all emirates. However, procedures differ in ways that catch people off guard.
          </p>

          <h3>Abu Dhabi Judicial Department (ADJD)</h3>

          <p>
            ADJD handles civil, commercial, and criminal cases in Abu Dhabi emirate. This includes Abu Dhabi City, Al Ain, and Al Dhafra regions. The <a href="/resources/adjd-translation-requirements/">ADJD translation requirements</a> have notable differences from Dubai.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Certified copies:</strong> ADJD often requires more stamped copies per filing than Dubai Courts</li>
            <li><strong>Submission format:</strong> ADJD has moved to electronic filing for many case types</li>
            <li><strong>Processing timelines:</strong> ADJD timelines differ from Dubai Courts for similar case types</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout-block">
            <strong>ADJD Circular 8/2023:</strong> Abu Dhabi judges may accept untranslated bank statements and invoices when the content is primarily numerical. This exception does not apply in Dubai Courts, where all foreign-language documents require full Arabic translation regardless of numerical content.
          </div>

          <h3>Dubai Courts</h3>

          <p>
            Dubai Courts follow UAE Civil Procedure Law Article 4. Arabic is mandatory. Every foreign-language document needs MOJ-certified translation. The court clerk verifies the translator's stamp before accepting documents into the system.
          </p>

          <p>
            Dubai Courts tend to be more rigid on formatting details. Paper size, page numbering, and binding requirements are enforced consistently. See our <a href="/resources/abu-dhabi-vs-dubai-translation/">full comparison guide</a> for a detailed breakdown.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 2: Free Zones -->
        <section id="free-zones">
          <h2>Free Zones: ADGM vs DIFC</h2>

          <p>
            Both ADGM and DIFC operate in English under common law. Both accept English documents without Arabic translation. The critical difference is which mainland court system handles enforcement.
          </p>

          <h3>ADGM (Abu Dhabi Global Market)</h3>

          <p>
            <a href="/resources/adgm-translation-requirements/">ADGM</a> is Abu Dhabi's international financial centre. English is the working language. Documents in English go directly to the ADGM Courts. Non-English documents require certified English translation.
          </p>

          <p>
            If an ADGM judgment needs enforcement against mainland assets, it goes through ADJD. That means Arabic translation under Abu Dhabi procedures, not Dubai procedures.
          </p>

          <h3>DIFC (Dubai International Financial Centre)</h3>

          <p>
            <a href="/resources/difc-translation-guide/">DIFC Courts</a> also operate in English. The same language rules apply. When enforcement moves to the mainland, it goes through Dubai Courts with their specific formatting and copy requirements.
          </p>

          <div class="comparison-table">
            <h3>ADGM vs DIFC: Enforcement Comparison</h3>
            <table>
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Factor</th>
                  <th>ADGM (Abu Dhabi)</th>
                  <th>DIFC (Dubai)</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>Working Language</td>
                  <td>English</td>
                  <td>English</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Legal System</td>
                  <td>Common Law</td>
                  <td>Common Law</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Mainland Enforcement</td>
                  <td>Through ADJD</td>
                  <td>Through Dubai Courts</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Enforcement Translation</td>
                  <td>ADJD Arabic requirements</td>
                  <td>Dubai Courts Arabic requirements</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </div>

          <p>
            The lesson: confirm the enforcement jurisdiction before ordering translation. ADGM and DIFC look similar on the surface. The downstream requirements are different.
          </p>

        <!-- Section 3: Healthcare -->
        <section id="healthcare">
          <h2>Healthcare: DOH Abu Dhabi vs DHA Dubai</h2>

          <p>
            Healthcare professionals face different licensing processes depending on which emirate they practice in. Translation requirements follow the regulator, not the profession.
          </p>

          <h3>Department of Health (DOH) — Abu Dhabi</h3>

          <p>
            DOH regulates healthcare in Abu Dhabi emirate. It runs its own equivalency evaluation for foreign medical credentials. Certified translation of degrees, transcripts, and professional certificates is required. DOH may also request attested translations for certain specialties.
          </p>

          <h3>Dubai Health Authority (DHA)</h3>

          <p>
            DHA regulates healthcare in Dubai. It uses the <a href="/specialized/medical/dha-dataflow/">DataFlow verification process</a> to authenticate credentials before licensing. Translation requirements feed into this verification pipeline.
          </p>

          <p>
            A medical professional moving from Abu Dhabi to Dubai (or vice versa) cannot assume their existing translations will satisfy the other authority. Each has its own forms, timelines, and submission methods.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 4: Real Estate -->
        <section id="real-estate">
          <h2>Real Estate: Abu Dhabi Municipalities vs DLD</h2>

          <p>
            Property transactions require translated documents at multiple stages. The authorities handling registration differ between emirates.
          </p>

          <h3>Abu Dhabi</h3>

          <p>
            Property in Abu Dhabi is registered through the relevant municipality. Abu Dhabi City, Al Ain, and Al Dhafra each have their own municipal authority. <a href="/legal/contracts/lease/">Lease agreements</a>, title deeds, and powers of attorney may need translation tailored to the specific municipality's requirements.
          </p>

          <h3>Dubai</h3>

          <p>
            Dubai Land Department (DLD) handles all property registration in Dubai. DLD has well-documented procedures and standard forms. Translation requirements are consistent across the emirate. Powers of attorney, sale agreements, and corporate documents all follow DLD's established format.
          </p>

          <p>
            For <a href="/legal/wills/">will registration</a> involving property in both emirates, you may need separate translations formatted for each jurisdiction's registration authority.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 5: Education -->
        <section id="education">
          <h2>Education: ADEK vs KHDA</h2>

          <p>
            School enrollment and credential recognition follow different paths in each emirate.
          </p>

          <h3>ADEK (Abu Dhabi Department of Education and Knowledge)</h3>

          <p>
            ADEK oversees schools in Abu Dhabi emirate. Translated academic records for school admission must meet ADEK's requirements. These include specific formatting for grade equivalency tables and academic transcripts.
          </p>

          <h3>KHDA (Knowledge and Human Development Authority)</h3>

          <p>
            KHDA regulates private education in Dubai. Academic document translation for KHDA follows its own standards. Parents transferring children between Abu Dhabi and Dubai schools should verify which authority's requirements apply at the receiving school.
          </p>

          <p>
            Both authorities accept MOJ-certified translation. The differences are in supplementary documentation and formatting expectations.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 6: The Common Mistake -->
        <section id="common-mistake">
          <h2>The Common Mistake: Assuming One Size Fits All</h2>

          <p>
            The most frequent error we see is people preparing documents for "the UAE" as if it were one jurisdiction. It is not. Each emirate has its own government entities with their own procedures.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here is what goes wrong:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Preparing documents for Dubai Courts when the case is filed with ADJD</li>
            <li>Using DHA forms for a DOH healthcare licensing application</li>
            <li>Assuming ADGM enforcement follows the same path as DIFC enforcement</li>
            <li>Submitting property documents formatted for DLD to an Abu Dhabi municipality</li>
            <li>Expecting ADJD Circular 8/2023 exceptions to apply in Dubai Courts</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Each of these mistakes costs time. Some cost filing fees. All of them are avoidable with a simple step: confirm which entity will receive your documents before you start.
          </p>

          <div class="callout-block">
            <strong>Before you order translation:</strong> Identify the specific government entity, court, or regulator that will receive your documents. Tell your translator which authority requires the documents. This single step prevents most cross-emirate submission errors.
          </div>
