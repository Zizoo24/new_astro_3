const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Do free zone companies need Arabic translation for all documents?",
    answer: "No. Many free zones accept English-only documentation for internal matters and intra-zone transactions. Arabic translation becomes necessary when dealing with mainland government bodies, local courts, employee visa processing through GDRFA, or real estate transactions outside the free zone."
  },
  {
    question: "Does DIFC accept documents in English only?",
    answer: "Yes. DIFC Courts operate under English common law and accept English documents without Arabic translation. DIFC-registered companies can conduct most internal and intra-zone business in English. Arabic is only needed when interacting with mainland authorities."
  },
  {
    question: "When does a JAFZA company need Arabic translation?",
    answer: "JAFZA companies need Arabic translation for employee visa applications through GDRFA, disputes escalated to Dubai Courts, contracts with mainland entities requiring notarization, and any filing with federal ministries like MOHRE or MOFA."
  },
  {
    question: "Is MOJ-certified translation required for free zone documents?",
    answer: "MOJ certification is required when free zone documents are submitted to UAE courts, government ministries, or federal bodies. For transactions within the free zone itself, certified translation without MOJ stamp is usually sufficient. Check with your free zone authority."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use English contracts with mainland companies?",
    answer: "You can draft contracts in English, but enforcement through UAE courts requires Arabic translation. Dubai Courts and Abu Dhabi Courts only accept Arabic submissions. Having an Arabic version ready prevents delays if disputes arise."
  },
  {
    question: "What about ADGM in Abu Dhabi? Same rules as DIFC?",
    answer: "ADGM follows a similar model to DIFC. English is the primary language for ADGM Courts and internal transactions. However, ADGM companies still need Arabic translation for Abu Dhabi government filings, employee visas, and any matter that reaches local courts."

        <p class="lead-text">The UAE has over 40 free zones, each with its own rules on language. Some accept English for nearly everything. Others mirror mainland Arabic requirements. This guide breaks down exactly when Arabic translation is needed and when English is sufficient.</p>

        <div class="callout-block">
          <i class="fas fa-balance-scale callout-block__icon"></i>
          <div class="callout-block__content">
            <p><strong>The General Rule:</strong> Inside a free zone, English often works. The moment you step outside that zone -- visas, local courts, mainland contracts, government filings -- Arabic becomes mandatory.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>The Core Distinction: Free Zone vs Mainland</h2>

        <p>UAE free zones operate as semi-autonomous jurisdictions. They set their own rules on business language, dispute resolution, and documentation. Mainland UAE follows federal law, where Arabic is the official language of courts and government.</p>

        <p>This creates a two-track system. A DIFC company can sign English contracts, file English court claims, and never touch Arabic -- until an employee needs a visa. A JAFZA company can operate in English daily, but any dispute reaching Dubai Courts requires Arabic translation.</p>

        <p>The mistake most companies make is assuming free zone English acceptance extends everywhere. It does not. Understanding where one jurisdiction ends and another begins saves time, money, and rejected filings.</p>

        <h2>When Arabic Translation IS Required (Even in Free Zones)</h2>

        <p>Regardless of which free zone you operate in, these situations always require Arabic translation.</p>

        <h3>Employee Visa Processing</h3>

        <p>Every employee visa in the UAE passes through GDRFA or the relevant immigration authority. These are federal bodies operating in Arabic. Free zone companies must submit Arabic translations of employment contracts, <a href="/personal/academic/degree/">degree certificates</a>, and <a href="/personal/immigration/pcc/">police clearance certificates</a> for visa processing.</p>

        <p>This catches many new free zone companies off guard. Your free zone license is in English. Your contracts are in English. But the visa application requires Arabic documentation.</p>

        <h3>Disputes Going to Local Courts</h3>

        <p>Free zone arbitration centers often accept English. However, enforcement of arbitration awards through local courts requires Arabic. If a commercial dispute escalates beyond the free zone's internal mechanisms, Dubai Courts or Abu Dhabi Courts only accept Arabic submissions.</p>

        <p>For this reason, companies with <a href="/legal/contracts/lease/">lease agreements</a> or commercial contracts should consider having Arabic versions ready. Waiting until a dispute arises creates urgency and higher costs.</p>

        <h3>Real Estate Outside the Zone</h3>

        <p>A DMCC company leasing office space in JLT (within the free zone) may handle paperwork in English. But purchasing property in Business Bay or leasing a warehouse in Al Quoz involves DLD and mainland authorities. These transactions require Arabic documentation.</p>

        <h3>Contracts with Mainland Entities</h3>

        <p>When a free zone company contracts with a mainland business, enforcement falls under UAE civil law. Arabic is the language of record. A purely English contract is valid between parties, but <a href="/resources/moj-vs-certified/">MOJ-certified Arabic translation</a> is needed to enforce it through courts.</p>

        <h3>Government and Regulatory Filings</h3>

        <p>Federal ministries operate in Arabic. This includes MOHRE for labour matters, MOFA for document attestation, and any interaction with municipal authorities. Free zone status does not exempt companies from these requirements.</p>

        <h2>When English IS Enough</h2>

        <p>These situations generally allow English-only documentation, depending on your specific free zone.</p>

        <h3>DIFC Courts</h3>

        <p>The <a href="/resources/difc-translation-guide/">DIFC operates its own court system</a> under English common law. English is the language of proceedings. Documents in English require no translation. Arabic documents submitted to DIFC Courts need English translation instead.</p>

        <p>DIFC-registered companies benefit from this significantly. Commercial disputes, employment matters within DIFC jurisdiction, and regulatory filings all proceed in English.</p>

        <h3>ADGM Courts</h3>

        <p><a href="/resources/adgm-translation-requirements/">Abu Dhabi Global Market</a> follows a similar model. ADGM Courts conduct proceedings in English under common law. Companies registered in ADGM can handle most legal matters in English within the ADGM framework.</p>

        <p>However, the same boundary applies. Any matter reaching Abu Dhabi local courts, or any filing with Abu Dhabi government bodies, requires Arabic.</p>

        <h3>International Arbitration</h3>

        <p>Many free zone contracts include international arbitration clauses (ICC, LCIA, DIAC). These proceedings typically accept English. The language of arbitration is usually specified in the contract clause itself.</p>

        <h3>Intra-Zone Contracts</h3>

        <p>Contracts between two companies within the same free zone generally proceed in English. Both parties operate under the free zone's rules. However, if the contract may need enforcement outside the zone, Arabic translation is advisable.</p>

        <h2>Free Zone Breakdown: Requirements by Zone</h2>

        <p>Each free zone has its own approach. Here is what to expect from the major zones.</p>

        <h3>DIFC (Dubai International Financial Centre)</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Internal operations:</strong> English</li>
          <li><strong>Court system:</strong> English (own courts)</li>
          <li><strong>Employee visas:</strong> Arabic required (GDRFA)</li>
          <li><strong>Mainland enforcement:</strong> Arabic required</li>
        </ul>

        <p>DIFC offers the most English-friendly environment in the UAE. Companies <a href="/legal/corporate/license/">forming entities</a> within DIFC can handle most matters in English. The exception remains government-facing processes.</p>

        <h3>ADGM (Abu Dhabi Global Market)</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Internal operations:</strong> English</li>
          <li><strong>Court system:</strong> English (own courts)</li>
          <li><strong>Employee visas:</strong> Arabic required (ICP/ICA)</li>
          <li><strong>Mainland enforcement:</strong> Arabic required</li>
        </ul>

        <p>ADGM mirrors DIFC in structure. <a href="/resources/abu-dhabi-vs-dubai-translation/">Abu Dhabi's growing financial sector</a> makes ADGM increasingly relevant for businesses needing English-language legal infrastructure.</p>

        <h3>JAFZA (Jebel Ali Free Zone)</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Internal operations:</strong> English (primary)</li>
          <li><strong>Dispute resolution:</strong> Own arbitration, but Dubai Courts for enforcement</li>
          <li><strong>Employee visas:</strong> Arabic required (GDRFA)</li>
          <li><strong>Mainland interactions:</strong> Arabic required</li>
        </ul>

        <p>JAFZA is the largest free zone in the UAE by trade volume. Daily operations proceed in English. But JAFZA does not have its own court system, so disputes ultimately require Arabic for Dubai Courts.</p>

        <h3>DMCC (Dubai Multi Commodities Centre)</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Internal operations:</strong> English</li>
          <li><strong>Dispute resolution:</strong> DMCC Arbitration Centre, then Dubai Courts</li>
          <li><strong>Employee visas:</strong> Arabic required (GDRFA)</li>
          <li><strong>Mainland interactions:</strong> Arabic required</li>
        </ul>

        <p>DMCC companies in JLT operate in English day-to-day. Translation needs arise with visa processing, mainland contracts, and any government interaction.</p>

        <h3>RAKEZ (Ras Al Khaimah Economic Zone)</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Internal operations:</strong> English accepted</li>
          <li><strong>Dispute resolution:</strong> RAK Courts (Arabic required)</li>
          <li><strong>Employee visas:</strong> Arabic required</li>
          <li><strong>Mainland interactions:</strong> Arabic required</li>
        </ul>

        <p>RAKEZ accepts English for registration and internal processes. Any legal matter escalating to RAK Courts requires Arabic. Companies with employees need Arabic translations for visa documentation.</p>

        <h3>Ajman Free Zone</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Internal operations:</strong> English and Arabic</li>
          <li><strong>Dispute resolution:</strong> Ajman Courts (Arabic required)</li>
          <li><strong>Employee visas:</strong> Arabic required</li>
          <li><strong>Mainland interactions:</strong> Arabic required</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Ajman Free Zone operates bilingually. Some processes require Arabic from the start. Companies should prepare Arabic documentation earlier than they might in DIFC or JAFZA.</p>

        <h2>Mainland Requirements: Arabic Is Non-Negotiable</h2>

        <p>Mainland UAE companies operate under federal and local law. Arabic is the official language of the UAE. Every court submission, government filing, and official application requires Arabic documentation.</p>

        <p>For mainland companies, the question is not whether you need Arabic translation. It is which certification level you need. <a href="/resources/moj-vs-certified/">MOJ-certified translation</a> is mandatory for courts and government bodies. Certified translation (without MOJ stamp) may suffice for private-sector interactions.</p>

        <p>Companies with <a href="/legal/corporate/moa/">memoranda of association</a> in English need Arabic translations for DED registration. <a href="/personal/immigration/license/">Professional licence holders</a> need Arabic translations for MOHRE work permit applications.</p>

        <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

        <h3>Assuming Free Zone Rules Apply Everywhere</h3>

        <p>The most frequent error. A DMCC company signs an English contract with a mainland supplier. A dispute arises. The company discovers Dubai Courts require Arabic translation of every document. The contract, correspondence, invoices -- everything needs translation under deadline pressure.</p>

        <h3>Forgetting Visa Requirements</h3>

        <p>Companies focus on commercial documents and forget that every employee hire triggers Arabic translation needs. Degree certificates, employment contracts, and police clearance all need Arabic versions for visa processing.</p>

        <h3>Using Uncertified Translation for Government</h3>

        <p>Online translation tools or bilingual staff cannot produce translations that courts accept. Government bodies require <a href="/legal/corporate/license/">certified or MOJ-certified translation</a> depending on the submission type.</p>

        <h3>Waiting Until Disputes Arise</h3>

        <p>Translating a 50-page contract under a court deadline costs more and takes longer than having it translated proactively. Companies with significant mainland exposure should maintain Arabic versions of key documents.</p>

        <h3>Not Checking the Specific Free Zone</h3>

        <p>Each free zone has its own rules. What works in DIFC may not work in RAKEZ. Always confirm language requirements with your free zone authority before assuming English is sufficient.</p>
