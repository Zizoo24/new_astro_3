        <p class="lead-text">If you've received visa requirements from GDRFA or filing instructions from Dubai Courts, you've probably encountered the term "MOJ-certified translation." This guide explains exactly what that means, who can provide it, and when you actually need it versus cheaper alternatives.</p>

        <div class="callout-block">
          <i class="fas fa-stamp callout-block__icon"></i>
          <div class="callout-block__content">
            <p><strong>Key Point:</strong> MOJ certification is not about translation quality. It's about who stamps the document. The same translator often provides both MOJ and certified translation—the difference is which seal they apply.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>What MOJ Translation Actually Means</h2>

        <p>MOJ stands for Ministry of Justice. An MOJ-certified translation is performed by a translator who holds a personal license from the UAE Ministry of Justice. This license allows them to stamp documents with a judiciary-recognized seal.</p>

        <p>The MOJ stamp carries legal weight in UAE courts and government bodies. It confirms the translator is accountable to the Ministry of Justice for the translation's accuracy. If a dispute arises, the translator can be called to defend their work.</p>

        <h3>What the MOJ Stamp Includes</h3>

        <p>Every MOJ-certified translation contains these elements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Translator's MOJ license number</strong> — Currently valid registration with Ministry of Justice</li>
          <li><strong>Official MOJ stamp</strong> — Judiciary-recognized seal (not a company stamp)</li>
          <li><strong>Translator's signature</strong> — Personal accountability for accuracy</li>
          <li><strong>Translation date</strong> — When the work was completed</li>
          <li><strong>Translator's name in Arabic</strong> — Full legal name matching license</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Our MOJ translations are executed through Arkan Legal Translation, License #701. The translator is Khaled Mohamed Abdulwahab Al-Adl. You can verify this license is current by calling the MOJ hotline at 800 333333.</p>

        <h2>Who Issues MOJ Translations</h2>

        <p>Not every translator can provide MOJ certification. The Ministry of Justice maintains a restricted registry of approved translators. Each translator undergoes background checks, language testing, and legal training before receiving their license.</p>

        <h3>How MOJ Licensing Works</h3>

        <p>MOJ licensing is a matter of personal liability. Individual translators are licensed, not companies. A translation agency like ours partners with MOJ-licensed translators to fulfill certification requirements.</p>

        <p>The license requires annual renewal. Expired licenses invalidate the certification. Always verify the translator's license is current before submitting documents to courts or government bodies.</p>

        <div class="callout-block callout-block--light">
          <i class="fas fa-lightbulb callout-block__icon"></i>
          <div class="callout-block__content">
            <p><strong>Verification Tip:</strong> Before accepting any MOJ translation, call 800 333333 and provide the translator's license number. The hotline confirms whether the license is valid and matches the name on your translation.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>When You Need MOJ Translation</h2>

        <p>MOJ certification is required when submitting documents to UAE courts and specific government authorities. These bodies explicitly mandate Ministry of Justice stamps in their filing requirements.</p>

        <h3>Dubai Courts and Judicial Proceedings</h3>

        <p>All <a href="/legal/litigation/">Dubai Courts submissions</a> require MOJ-certified translations. This includes civil cases, family law matters, commercial disputes, and criminal proceedings. Judges will reject documents bearing only agency stamps.</p>

        <p>The <a href="/legal/litigation/arbitration/">DIFC Courts</a>, though operating under common law, still require certified translations when Arabic documents are submitted. ADGM Courts in Abu Dhabi follow similar requirements.</p>

        <h3>GDRFA Visa and Immigration Applications</h3>

        <p>The General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs requires MOJ certification for most visa types. This includes family sponsorship, Golden Visa applications, and residency permit renewals.</p>

        <p>Documents needing MOJ certification for GDRFA include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/personal/vital-records/birth/">Birth certificates</a> for dependent visa applications</li>
          <li><a href="/personal/vital-records/marriage/">Marriage certificates</a> for spouse sponsorship</li>
          <li><a href="/personal/academic/degree/">University degrees</a> for skilled worker visas</li>
          <li><a href="/personal/immigration/pcc/">Police clearance certificates</a> for residence permits</li>
          <li><a href="/personal/vital-records/divorce/">Divorce decrees</a> for visa status updates</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>MOHRE Work Permits and Labor Relations</h3>

        <p>The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation requires MOJ certification for employment visa processing. Academic credentials, professional licenses, and experience certificates submitted to MOHRE must carry the MOJ stamp.</p>

        <h3>DLD Property Transactions</h3>

        <p>Dubai Land Department requires MOJ-certified translations for property registration documents. This includes sale agreements, mortgage documents, and ownership transfers involving foreign-language paperwork.</p>

        <p>RERA, the rental dispute settlement authority, also requires MOJ certification when <a href="/legal/contracts/lease/">lease agreements</a> are submitted in languages other than Arabic.</p>

        <h3>Family Law and Estate Matters</h3>

        <p>Family law proceedings—marriage registration, divorce, child custody, inheritance—require MOJ certification. This applies whether filing with Dubai Courts, DIFC Wills Service Centre, or Abu Dhabi Judicial Department.</p>

        <p><a href="/legal/wills/">Wills and testaments</a> submitted for probate must be MOJ-certified. Foreign wills used in UAE inheritance matters need both translation and attestation through official channels.</p>

        <h3>Notary Public Submissions</h3>

        <p>When notarizing documents at UAE notary offices, any foreign-language text requires MOJ-certified translation. This includes <a href="/legal/corporate/poa/">Powers of Attorney</a>, affidavits, and declarations.</p>

        <h2>When You Don't Need MOJ Translation</h2>

        <p>Many people pay for MOJ certification when cheaper certified translation would suffice. Private entities—banks, employers, universities—rarely require Ministry of Justice stamps.</p>

        <h3>Banks and Financial Institutions</h3>

        <p>UAE banks accept certified translation for account opening, loan applications, mortgage documents, and proof of income. Unless you're dealing with a court-ordered freeze or legal dispute, <a href="/resources/moj-vs-certified/">certified translation</a> meets banking requirements.</p>

        <h3>HR Departments and Employers</h3>

        <p>Private companies accept certified translation for employment onboarding. This includes translated degrees, experience certificates, employment contracts, and identity documents. MOJ certification is unnecessary unless MOHRE specifically requires it for visa processing.</p>

        <h3>University Admissions</h3>

        <p>Most UAE universities accept certified translation for admissions purposes. The exception is when credentials require MOHESR equivalency assessment—that process may specify MOJ certification. Confirm requirements with the specific institution.</p>

        <h3>Insurance Companies</h3>

        <p>Health insurance, vehicle insurance, and property insurance claims accept certified translation. Medical reports, police reports, and incident documentation don't require MOJ stamps for claims processing.</p>

        <h3>Internal Corporate Use</h3>

        <p>Business contracts, vendor agreements, compliance documentation, and internal records rarely require MOJ certification. Certified translation provides sufficient authentication for private business purposes.</p>

        <div class="callout-block callout-block--light">
          <i class="fas fa-money-bill-wave callout-block__icon"></i>
          <div class="callout-block__content">
            <p><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> Certified translation often costs 30-50% less than MOJ certification. Always ask the receiving party whether MOJ is explicitly required—you may save money without compromising acceptance.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>MOJ vs Certified vs Notarized Translation</h2>

        <p>Understanding the three certification levels prevents overpaying or underdelivering on requirements.</p>

            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <p>Notice that translation quality is identical across all three. The difference is the certification level, not the language work itself.</p>

        <h2>How MOJ Translation Works</h2>

        <p>The process differs from regular certified translation only in the final stamp application. Translation quality and review steps remain the same.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Document Submission and Assessment</h3>

        <p>Send your document via WhatsApp to +971 50 862 0217. We review it to confirm it's suitable for translation. Common issues identified at this stage include poor scan quality, incomplete pages, or documents requiring <a href="/services/attestation/">attestation</a> before translation.</p>

        <p>We also confirm whether MOJ certification is actually required for your intended use. This prevents unnecessary expense when certified translation would suffice.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Translation Execution</h3>

        <p>A qualified translator converts your document into the target language. Legal documents require translators with expertise in legal terminology—Arabic-English legal translation differs significantly from general translation.</p>

        <p>For specialized documents like <a href="/legal/contracts/spa/">sale and purchase agreements</a> or <a href="/legal/litigation/verdict/">court verdicts</a>, we assign translators with specific experience in those document types.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Quality Review</h3>

        <p>Every translation undergoes review for accuracy, completeness, and formatting. Names, dates, figures, and legal terms are verified against the original. For court submissions, formatting must match specific requirements.</p>

        <h3>Step 4: MOJ Stamp Application</h3>

        <p>The MOJ-licensed translator applies their personal stamp and signature. They take legal responsibility for the translation's accuracy. Their license number appears on the document for verification purposes.</p>

        <p>This step distinguishes MOJ translation from certified translation—the stamp comes from a Ministry of Justice registry, not an agency seal.</p>

        <h3>Step 5: Delivery</h3>

        <p>You receive the MOJ-certified translation along with your original document. For court submissions requiring multiple copies, we provide certified copies as needed.</p>

        <h2>Cost and Timeline</h2>

        <p>MOJ translation pricing depends on document length, language pair, and complexity. Standard personal documents start from AED 150. Legal contracts and technical documents cost more due to specialized terminology.</p>

        <h3>Typical Pricing by Document Type</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Personal certificates</strong> (birth, marriage, divorce, death): AED 150-200 per certificate</li>
          <li><strong>Academic documents</strong> (degrees, transcripts): AED 150-250 depending on length</li>
          <li><strong>Police clearance certificates</strong>: AED 150-200</li>
          <li><strong>Simple contracts</strong> (under 3 pages): AED 200-400</li>
          <li><strong>Complex legal documents</strong>: Quoted per page based on terminology density</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Standard Timeline</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Simple documents</strong> (certificates): 60 minutes to 3 business hours</li>
          <li><strong>Contracts and agreements</strong> (under 10 pages): 1-2 business days</li>
          <li><strong>Court bundles</strong> (large volumes): Based on total page count and complexity</li>
          <li><strong>Urgent requests</strong>: Same-day service available with express fee</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Always factor translation time into court deadlines. Waiting until the last day creates unnecessary stress and limits review time.</p>

        <h2>Common Myths About MOJ Translation</h2>

        <p>Several misconceptions about MOJ certification lead to confusion and overpayment.</p>

        <h3>Myth 1: All UAE Translations Must Be MOJ-Certified</h3>

        <p><strong>False.</strong> Only government bodies and courts require MOJ certification. Private entities—banks, employers, universities—accept certified translation. Many people overpay by requesting MOJ when certified would suffice.</p>

        <h3>Myth 2: MOJ Translation Is More Accurate</h3>

        <p><strong>False.</strong> The same translator often provides both MOJ and certified translation. Translation quality and accuracy are identical. The only difference is the stamp applied at the end.</p>

        <p>Think of it like regular mail versus registered mail. Same contents, different delivery confirmation. Choose based on recipient requirements, not perceived quality.</p>

        <h3>Myth 3: You Can Get MOJ Translation at Any Typing Center</h3>

        <p><strong>Partially true.</strong> Some typing centers have arrangements with MOJ-licensed translators. Others use agency stamps and incorrectly call it "MOJ translation." Always verify the translator's license number before submission.</p>

        <h3>Myth 4: Online MOJ Translation Isn't Valid</h3>

        <p><strong>False.</strong> As long as the translator holds a current MOJ license, the translation is valid regardless of how you submitted the document. Dubai Courts and GDRFA accept translations from licensed translators whether you used WhatsApp, email, or physical delivery.</p>

        <p>What matters is the stamp authenticity, not the submission method.</p>

        <h3>Myth 5: MOJ Translators Only Work for the Government</h3>

        <p><strong>False.</strong> MOJ-licensed translators work independently or partner with agencies. The license allows them to stamp documents for public submission, but they operate as private professionals or through service providers.</p>

        <h2>Verifying MOJ Translator Credentials</h2>

        <p>Before accepting any MOJ-certified translation, verify the translator's credentials. This prevents issues when submitting to courts or government bodies.</p>

        <h3>How to Verify an MOJ License</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>Note the translator's full name in Arabic from the translation</li>
          <li>Note the MOJ license number stamped on the document</li>
          <li>Call the MOJ hotline at 800 333333</li>
          <li>Provide the license number and translator name</li>
          <li>Confirm the license is currently valid (not expired)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This verification takes under 5 minutes and prevents rejection due to expired or fake credentials.</p>

        <h2>What to Do If Your MOJ Translation Is Rejected</h2>

        <p>Rejection typically occurs due to formatting issues, missing elements, or expired translator licenses. It rarely indicates translation inaccuracy.</p>

        <h3>Common Rejection Reasons</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Expired translator license</strong> — License was valid when translated but expired before submission</li>
          <li><strong>Missing stamp elements</strong> — Translator forgot to include license number or date</li>
          <li><strong>Formatting issues</strong> — Court-specific format requirements not followed</li>
          <li><strong>Incomplete pages</strong> — Original document had multiple pages but translation only covered some</li>
          <li><strong>Mismatched information</strong> — Names or dates don't match original exactly</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If a translation we provide is rejected by Dubai Courts, GDRFA, or any government body due to our error, we correct and resubmit at no additional service fee. You only pay if the rejection stems from issues with your original document.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What does MOJ stand for in translation?</summary>
          <p>MOJ stands for Ministry of Justice. An MOJ-certified translation is performed by a translator registered with the UAE Ministry of Justice. The translator's license number, stamp, and signature authenticate the document for use in courts and government bodies.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Is MOJ translation the same as certified translation?</summary>
          <p>No. MOJ translation carries a Ministry of Justice-recognized stamp from a sworn translator. Certified translation uses an agency stamp. Both deliver the same translation quality, but courts and ministries require MOJ certification.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Who can provide MOJ-certified translation?</summary>
          <p>Only translators licensed by the UAE Ministry of Justice can provide MOJ-certified translations. Each translator has a personal license number, valid stamp, and signature. You can verify any translator's license by calling the MOJ hotline at 800 333333.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>When do I need MOJ translation instead of certified translation?</summary>
          <p>You need MOJ translation for Dubai Courts, GDRFA visa applications, MOHRE work permits, DLD property transactions, RERA rental disputes, notary submissions, and government ministry filings. For banks, employers, and private companies, certified translation is usually sufficient.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How much does MOJ translation cost?</summary>
          <p>MOJ translation starts from AED 150 for standard documents like certificates. Price depends on document length, language pair, and urgency. Complex legal documents cost more due to specialized terminology.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Can I use MOJ translation for private companies?</summary>
          <p>Yes, but it's often unnecessary. MOJ translation works everywhere certified translation does. However, private companies rarely require the MOJ stamp, so certified translation saves money while meeting their requirements.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Is MOJ translation higher quality than certified translation?</summary>
          <p>No. Both services deliver identical translation quality and accuracy. The only difference is the certification authority—Ministry of Justice stamp versus agency stamp. Choose based on your recipient's requirements, not perceived quality.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How long does MOJ translation take?</summary>
          <p>Standard documents like birth certificates, marriage certificates, and degrees take 60 minutes to 3 business hours. Complex legal documents like contracts or court judgments take 1-3 business days. Same-day service available for urgent requirements.</p>
