      answer: "Yes. Our MOJ-certified translations are accepted for DIFC Courts proceedings. While DIFC Courts primarily operate in English, Arabic translations may be required for certain matters or when documents need to be used in mainland UAE courts."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you understand DIFC's common law system?",
      answer: "Yes. We are familiar with the English common law terminology used in DIFC. This is important because legal concepts may not have direct Arabic equivalents, and careful translation is required to preserve legal meaning."
