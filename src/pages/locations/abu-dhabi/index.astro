  heroIntro={`<p>Abu Dhabi's role as the UAE capital means navigating both federal and emirate-level authorities. Whether you need documents for <a href='/legal/litigation/'>ADJD court proceedings</a>, <a href='/legal/corporate/'>ADGM company formation</a>, <a href='/specialized/medical/'>DOH healthcare licensing</a>, or <a href='/personal/immigration/'>ICA visa applications</a>, we provide MOJ-certified translations that Abu Dhabi authorities accept.</p>

<h3>What Makes Abu Dhabi Requirements Distinct</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dual legal system</strong> — ADJD operates under UAE civil law (Arabic required), while ADGM operates under English common law</li>
<li><strong>Federal capital complexity</strong> — Submissions often involve emirate-level (ADDED, DOH) and federal bodies (ICA, MOFA)</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare licensing</strong> — Department of Health has specific credential translation requirements</li>
<li><strong>TAMM integration</strong> — Abu Dhabi's unified platform accepts our MOJ-certified translations</li>
</ul>

<h3>Authorities That Accept Our Translations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>ADJD</strong> — Civil, commercial, family, and criminal court proceedings</li>
<li><strong>ICA Abu Dhabi</strong> — Residency visas, Emirates ID, citizenship applications</li>
<li><strong>ADGM</strong> — Financial free zone with English common law courts</li>
<li><strong>ADDED</strong> — Business licensing, commercial registration</li>
<li><strong>DOH</strong> — Healthcare professional and facility licensing</li>
<li><strong>ADEK</strong> — School enrollment, credential evaluation</li>
</ul>

          <h2>Why Abu Dhabi Businesses and Residents Choose Us</h2>
          
          <p>Abu Dhabi is the UAE capital. This means extra complexity. Your documents may need to meet federal and emirate rules at the same time.</p>

          <p>We handle this every day. Our team knows what each authority needs.</p>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> Abu Dhabi-Specific Expertise</h4>
            <ul class="check-list">
              <li>ADJD court terminology and formatting</li>
              <li>DOH healthcare licensing requirements</li>
              <li>ICA visa document standards</li>
              <li>ADGM common law conventions</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h3>Abu Dhabi's Two Legal Systems</h3>

          <p>Abu Dhabi has two different legal frameworks:</p>

          <div class="system-cards">
            <div class="system-card">
              <h4><i class="fas fa-landmark"></i> Mainland Abu Dhabi</h4>
              <p><strong>Law:</strong> UAE Federal Law</p>
              <p><strong>Language:</strong> Arabic required</p>
              <p><strong>Authorities:</strong> ADJD, ADDED, ICA</p>
            </div>
            <div class="system-card">
              <h4><i class="fas fa-university"></i> ADGM</h4>
              <p><strong>Law:</strong> English Common Law</p>
              <p><strong>Language:</strong> English primary</p>
              <p><strong>Authority:</strong> ADGM Courts, ADGM RA</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>A <a href="/legal/contracts/">contract</a> for ADGM uses different terms than one for ADJD. We match your translation to your specific need.</p>

          <h3>ADJD Court Documents</h3>

          <p>ADJD handles all court matters in Abu Dhabi emirate. All proceedings need Arabic documents.</p>

          <p><strong>Documents we translate for ADJD:</strong></p>
          <ul class="simple-list">
            <li>Foreign court judgments</li>

            <li>Professional development records</li>
