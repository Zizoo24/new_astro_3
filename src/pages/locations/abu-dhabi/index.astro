      <h2>Serving Abu Dhabi from Dubai</h2>
      <div class="content-prose">
        <p>Abu Dhabi is the UAE's capital and home to federal government ministries, major corporations, and significant residential population. While our physical base is in Dubai, we serve Abu Dhabi clients with the same quality and responsiveness through our remote workflow and reliable courier delivery.</p>
        
        <p>The 90-minute drive between Dubai and Abu Dhabi means next-day delivery is straightforward. For urgent matters, same-day courier is available. Digital documents are delivered instantly, so you can have a PDF for immediate use while waiting for physical copies.</p>
        
        <h3>Why Abu Dhabi Clients Choose Us</h3>
        <p>Many Abu Dhabi residents and businesses work with Dubai-based translation services because of the concentration of MOJ-licensed translators in Dubai and the ease of remote workflow. You do not need to visit an office or make multiple trips. Send documents via WhatsApp, approve the quote, and receive your translation delivered to your door.</p>
        
        <p>For federal government submissions, court filings, or corporate documentation, our MOJ certification is valid throughout the UAE. There is no difference in acceptance between translation done in Dubai and Abu Dhabi—MOJ licensing is federal.</p>
        
        <h3>Understanding Abu Dhabi's Distinct Needs</h3>
        <p>Abu Dhabi has its own governmental structure alongside the federal ministries headquartered there. ADJD (Abu Dhabi Judicial Department) handles local court matters. Abu Dhabi DED manages local business licensing. ADGM operates as a separate financial free zone under common law. We understand these distinctions and advise appropriately.</p>

      <h2>Federal Government and Ministry Documents</h2>
      <div class="content-prose">
        <h3>Working with Federal Authorities</h3>
        <p>Many UAE federal ministries are headquartered in Abu Dhabi: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation, and others. Documents for these ministries—whether personal immigration matters, employment documentation, or official correspondence—require MOJ-certified translation.</p>
        
        <p>We translate documents for federal authority submissions regularly and understand the terminology and formatting expectations. Whether you are dealing with visa matters, employment permits, or official applications, we provide translations that meet federal standards.</p>
        
        <h3>Immigration and Visa Documents</h3>
        <p>Abu Dhabi residents processing visa applications, family sponsorship, or <a href="/services/golden-visa-translation/">Golden Visa</a> applications need translated documents for federal immigration authorities. <a href="/personal/vital-records/birth/">Birth certificates</a>, <a href="/personal/vital-records/marriage/">marriage certificates</a>, <a href="/personal/education/degree/">degree certificates</a>, and other supporting documents all require MOJ-certified translation.</p>
        
        <h3>Employment Documentation</h3>
        <p>MOHRE processing for Abu Dhabi-based employees follows the same federal requirements as elsewhere in the UAE. <a href="/services/certificate-translation/">Certificate translation</a> for work permits, salary certificate translation, and employment contract translation all meet MOHRE standards.</p>

      <h2>Abu Dhabi Judicial Department (ADJD)</h2>
      <div class="content-prose">
        <h3>Court Documents and Legal Filings</h3>
        <p>ADJD handles civil, criminal, and personal status cases in Abu Dhabi. Court filings, evidence documents, and legal submissions may require translation. We provide MOJ-certified translations that ADJD accepts for all court proceedings.</p>
        
        <p>For <a href="/services/legal-translation/">legal translation</a> involving Abu Dhabi courts, we work with individuals and law firms to meet court deadlines and formatting requirements. Urgent court filings can be accommodated with our Express and VIP Concierge services.</p>
        
        <h3>Personal Status Matters</h3>
        <p>Divorce proceedings, custody matters, and inheritance cases in Abu Dhabi require translated documents when parties or evidence involve foreign elements. Marriage certificates, birth certificates, foreign court orders, and other civil documents need certified translation for court submission.</p>
        
        <h3>Commercial Litigation</h3>
        <p>Business disputes before Abu Dhabi courts may involve contracts, correspondence, and corporate documents in languages other than Arabic. We translate commercial documentation for litigation support, working with law firms on volume and deadline requirements.</p>

        <p>ADGM is Abu Dhabi's financial free zone, operating under English common law similar to <a href="/locations/dubai/difc/">DIFC</a> in Dubai. Companies registered in ADGM use English as the primary operating language, with documentation following common law conventions.</p>
        
        <p>ADGM entities may need Arabic translation when dealing with mainland Abu Dhabi authorities, opening bank accounts with UAE banks, or engaging in property transactions. We translate ADGM corporate documents to Arabic with awareness of common law concepts and their Arabic equivalents.</p>
        
        <h3>ADGM Courts</h3>
        <p>ADGM operates its own courts under English common law. Proceedings occur primarily in English, but Arabic documents introduced as evidence require certified translation. We support ADGM court filings with translations that meet court requirements.</p>
        
        <h3>Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA)</h3>
        <p>ADGM's FSRA regulates financial services within the free zone. Regulatory correspondence, license applications, and compliance documents may require translation when dealing with other regulatory bodies or for record-keeping purposes.</p>
