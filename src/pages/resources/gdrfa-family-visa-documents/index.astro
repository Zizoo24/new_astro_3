const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What documents do I need for a UAE family visa at GDRFA?",
    answer: "You need your passport (with valid residency), sponsor's passport, Emirates ID copies, marriage certificate (attested and translated), birth certificates for children, salary certificate, tenancy contract (Ejari), and passport photos. All foreign-language documents must be translated into Arabic by an MOJ-certified translator."
  },
  {
    question: "Do all family visa documents need Arabic translation?",
    answer: "Yes. GDRFA requires Arabic for all documents not originally issued in Arabic. This includes marriage certificates, birth certificates, salary certificates, and any supporting documents from your home country. Send your documents via <a href='https://wa.me/971508620217'>WhatsApp</a> and we confirm which ones need translation."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I get attestation before or after translation?",
    answer: "Attestation first, translation second. Your translation must capture all attestation stamps and stickers. If you translate before attesting, the translation won't include the attestation marks, and you will need to pay for a complete retranslation."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the full family visa document process take?",
    answer: "Attestation takes 1-3 working days through MOFA's eDAS system. Translation takes 24 hours standard or 2-4 hours express. The typing center submission and GDRFA review add 3-7 working days. Total realistic timeline: 2-3 weeks from start to entry permit."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I submit family visa documents directly to GDRFA?",
    answer: "No. GDRFA processes family visa applications through approved typing centers and the Amer system. You cannot upload directly to the GDRFA portal yourself. There are approximately 600 approved typing centers in Dubai that handle submissions."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the attestation chain for non-Hague countries like Pakistan?",
    answer: "For Pakistan (not a Hague member), the chain is: home country authentication, Pakistan MOFA, UAE Embassy in Pakistan, then UAE MOFA attestation in Dubai. Only after this full chain do you get translation. For Hague countries like India, the chain is shorter: notarization, apostille, then UAE MOFA."
  },
  {
    question: "Will GDRFA tell me why my application was rejected?",
    answer: "Usually not in detail. GDRFA rejection notices are mostly generic, showing 'Rejected' as a status with limited explanation. If documents are missing, you may receive a notification to attach them within 30 days. This is why getting documents right before submission matters."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need separate translations for each family member?",
    answer: "Each person on the visa application needs their own translated documents. A child's birth certificate is a separate translation from the marriage certificate. However, shared documents like the sponsor's salary certificate only need one translation."
  },
  {
    question: "What salary is required to sponsor a family visa in Dubai?",
    answer: "Dubai requires a minimum salary of AED 4,000 (or AED 3,000 plus accommodation) for family sponsorship. The salary certificate must be in Arabic and reflect current employment. Some typing centers reject salary certificates older than 30 days."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I sponsor parents on a family visa?",
    answer: "Yes, but parent sponsorship has additional requirements. You need a minimum salary of AED 20,000, a two-bedroom accommodation, and health insurance for each parent. Document requirements include the parent's passport, birth certificate proving relationship, and medical fitness certificate."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if my marriage certificate is from a non-Hague country?",
    answer: "Countries like Pakistan and Egypt require the full attestation chain: home country authentication, home country MOFA, UAE Embassy, then UAE MOFA. This adds 1-2 weeks compared to Hague member countries where apostille replaces the embassy step. Plan accordingly."
  },
  {
    question: "Is the approved typing center list the same across all emirates?",
    answer: "No. Typing centers are approved per emirate. Dubai has approximately 600 GDRFA-approved centers. Abu Dhabi and Sharjah have their own networks. Our translation is accepted everywhere, but ensure your typing center is approved for your specific emirate."

        Applying for a UAE family visa through GDRFA involves six steps across three separate government systems. Most delays happen because applicants get the sequence wrong — attesting after translating, or skipping MOFA entirely. This guide covers every document you need, the exact order to process them, and the mistakes that trigger rejections.

      <h2>Documents Required for Family Visa Sponsorship</h2>
      <p>GDRFA requires specific documents depending on who you are sponsoring. Here is the full list, sorted by document source.</p>

      <h3>Sponsor's Documents (Already in UAE)</h3>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li><strong>Valid passport</strong> with UAE residence visa (minimum 6 months validity)</li>
        <li><strong>Emirates ID</strong> — both sides</li>
        <li><strong>Salary certificate</strong> from employer — must show minimum AED 4,000 (or AED 3,000 plus accommodation). Must be in Arabic or <a href="/legal-translation-dubai/">translated to Arabic</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Tenancy contract</strong> (Ejari) — proving adequate accommodation</li>
        <li><strong>Passport-size photographs</strong> — white background, recent</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Spouse Visa Documents (From Home Country)</h3>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li><strong><a href="/personal/vital-records/marriage/">Marriage certificate</a></strong> — original, attested and translated to Arabic</li>
        <li><strong>Spouse's passport</strong> — valid for minimum 6 months</li>
        <li><strong>Spouse's passport photographs</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Child Visa Documents (Per Child)</h3>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li><strong><a href="/personal/vital-records/birth/">Birth certificate</a></strong> — original, attested and translated to Arabic</li>
        <li><strong>Child's passport</strong> — valid for minimum 6 months</li>
        <li><strong>Child's passport photographs</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Parent Sponsorship (Additional Requirements)</h3>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li><strong>Minimum salary of AED 20,000</strong> (higher threshold than spouse/child)</li>
        <li><strong>Two-bedroom accommodation</strong> minimum</li>
        <li><strong>Birth certificate</strong> proving parent-child relationship — attested and translated</li>
        <li><strong>Health insurance</strong> for each parent</li>
        <li><strong>Medical fitness certificate</strong> after arrival</li>
      </ul>

        <h4>Documents That Do NOT Need Translation</h4>

            <p>GDRFA requires original documents, not certified copies. If your <a href="/personal/vital-records/marriage/">marriage certificate</a> or <a href="/personal/vital-records/birth/">birth certificate</a> is with your family back home, they need to send the original.</p>
            <p>For countries that issue multiple originals (like India), one original is sufficient. For countries that issue a single original, check if your home country's civil registry can issue a certified duplicate.</p>

            <h3>UAE MOFA Attestation</h3>
            <p>All foreign documents — whether apostilled or embassy-attested — must pass through <a href="/services/attestation/">UAE MOFA attestation</a>. This step validates the foreign authentication for use in UAE government systems.</p>

              <li><strong>System:</strong> eDAS 2.0 (digital attestation)</li>

            <p>After attestation is complete, have your documents translated into Arabic by an <a href="/legal-translation-dubai/">MOJ-certified translator</a>. This step MUST come after attestation, not before.</p>

              <h4>The Most Expensive Mistake</h4>
              <p>If you translate before attesting, your translation will not include the MOFA attestation stamps and stickers. GDRFA will reject the application. You will need to pay for a complete retranslation after attestation. We see this mistake regularly.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Dubai:</strong> Approximately 600 GDRFA-approved typing centers</li>

              <li><strong>What they do:</strong> Enter all data from your documents into the GDRFA portal, upload scanned copies, and submit the application</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Bring all original documents plus their Arabic translations. The typing center will need both. Some centers also handle the application fee payment (currently AED 300 for the entry permit).</p>

            <ul>
