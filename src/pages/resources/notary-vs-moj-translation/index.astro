    question: "What does a Notary Public do in Dubai?",
    answer: "A notary public verifies identities, witnesses signatures, and certifies that documents are genuine. They are authorized by Dubai Courts to confirm you are who you say you are and that you signed what you say you signed. A notary does not translate documents."
  },
  {
    question: "What is MOJ Legal Translation?",
    answer: "MOJ Legal Translation converts documents from one language to another through translators registered with the UAE Ministry of Justice. The translation carries an MOJ-approved stamp and QR verification code, making it legally recognized by UAE courts and government entities."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need both notary and translation services?",
    answer: "Often yes, but at different stages. Many document processes require both services. For example, court submissions may need MOJ translation of the document AND notarization if you're also certifying copies or signing Power of Attorney."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I translate before or after attestation?",
    answer: "Generally, complete attestation FIRST (on the original document in its original language), THEN translate the fully-attested document. The translation will include all attestation stamps. Translating before attestation means you'll need to translate again after."
  },
  {
    question: "Do banks require MOJ Legal Translation?",
    answer: "No. Banks are private entities and typically accept certified translation for documents like passports, visas, and employment letters. Using MOJ translation for bank requirements means paying more for no additional benefit."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between certified true copy and certified translation?",
    answer: "A certified true copy means a notary confirms a photocopy matches the original—it stays in the same language. A certified translation means the document has been rendered into another language. These are different services; some processes require both."

      <p class="hero-subtitle">Which One Do You Actually Need?</p>
      <p class="hero-intro">The terms "notary public," "legal translation," "attestation," and "certification" get used interchangeably—even by professionals. But using the wrong service can mean rejected applications, wasted money, and lost time. Let's untangle this once and for all.</p>

          <h3>Notary Public in Dubai</h3>
          <p>Deals with <strong>verifying identities</strong>, witnessing signatures, and certifying that documents are genuine. A notary confirms that you are who you say you are and that you signed what you say you signed.</p>
          <div class="key-point">
            <strong>A notary does NOT translate anything.</strong>

          <h3>MOJ Legal Translation</h3>
          <p>Deals with <strong>converting documents from one language to another</strong> through translators registered with the UAE Ministry of Justice. The translator produces an Arabic or English version that's legally recognized.</p>
          <div class="key-point">
            <strong>A translator does NOT verify your identity.</strong>

      <div class="confusion-note">
        <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i>
        <div>
          <strong>Why the confusion?</strong> Many document processes require BOTH services at different stages, and some providers offer BOTH under one roof. When you hear "notarized translation," people often mean a translation that has been notarized after completion—two separate services combined.
