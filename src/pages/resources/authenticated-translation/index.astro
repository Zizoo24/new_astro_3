  {
    question: "How long does certified translation take?",
    answer: "Standard turnaround for most documents is 24-48 hours, though complex materials may take longer. Many translation services in Dubai offer same-day or express options for urgent needs at additional cost."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I translate my own documents?",
    answer: "No—for official purposes in the UAE, self-translation is not accepted. The translation must be performed and certified by an MOJ-registered translator, even if you're fluent in both languages."
  },
  {
    question: "Is MOJ certification valid throughout the UAE?",
    answer: "Yes. MOJ certification is recognized across all emirates—Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and beyond. You don't need separate certification for different emirates."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my document is in a rare language?",
    answer: "The MOJ has registered translators for numerous language pairs. If your document is in an unusual language, contact a translation agency to confirm availability. They can often connect you with certified translators for less common languages."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need the original document or is a copy sufficient?",
    answer: "For the translation itself, a clear copy is usually sufficient. However, when submitting to authorities, you'll typically need to present both the original document and the translation together."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between certified and legal translation?",
    answer: "In the UAE, certified translation uses an agency stamp and is accepted by HR, banks, and private companies. Legal translation (MOJ) carries a judiciary-recognized seal from an MOJ-registered translator, required for courts and government ministries."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I verify an MOJ translator is legitimate?",
    answer: "You can verify any MOJ-licensed translator by calling the Ministry of Justice hotline at 800 333333. Ask for the translator's registration number and license validity."
  },
  {
    question: "Do translated documents expire?",
    answer: "Translations themselves don't expire, but some authorities require translations to be recent (within 3-6 months). Always check with your receiving authority for specific time requirements."
  }

      <p class="lead-paragraph">
        If you've ever needed to submit documents to a government authority in Dubai or anywhere else in the UAE,
        you've probably encountered the term <span class="keyword">authenticated translation</span>. Perhaps a clerk
        handed back your paperwork with a polite but firm request for a "legal translation" or "certified translation,"
        and you found yourself wondering: <em>what exactly do they need?</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        You're not alone. Understanding what makes a translated document officially recognized can feel overwhelming.
        But once you understand the basics, the process becomes straightforward.
      </p>

        <span>Understanding the Basics</span>
      </div>

      <h2>What Is Authenticated Translation?</h2>

      <p>
        At its core, <span class="keyword">authenticated translation</span> refers to a translated document verified
        and approved by a recognized authority. In the UAE, this typically means a translation carrying the
        <span class="keyword-gold">stamp and signature</span> of a translator registered with the Ministry of Justice.
      </p>

      <div class="pullquote">
        <p>
          Without proper authentication, your translated document is essentially just a piece of paper—it won't
          be recognized by courts, won't be valid for visa applications, and won't satisfy UAE government agencies.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        When you present a document to a court, immigration office, or government agency in the UAE, they need
        certainty that the translation is accurate and complete. The authentication process provides that official
        seal of trust—a guarantee that a qualified professional translator has certified the accuracy.

          Important Distinction
        </div>
        <p>
          In the UAE, when a government office asks for a "certified translation," what they actually require is an
          <span class="keyword">MOJ-certified legal translation</span>. The terms have become interchangeable in
          local usage, but the requirement remains the same: translation by an MOJ-registered translator.

      </div>

        <span>MOJ Requirements</span>
      </div>

      <h2>What Makes a Translation MOJ-Accepted?</h2>

      <p>
        For a translation to be accepted by UAE authorities, it must meet specific criteria established by the
        Ministry of Justice.
      </p>

      <h3>The MOJ Registration Requirement</h3>

      <p>
        The most fundamental requirement: the translator must be registered with and approved by the UAE Ministry
        of Justice. This isn't optional. No matter how skilled a translator might be, if they're not on the MOJ's
        approved list, their translations won't be recognized by UAE courts or government agencies.
      </p>

      <div class="feature-grid">
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Demonstrated Proficiency</h4>
          <p>Tested competency in both source and target language</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Official Registration Number</h4>
          <p>Unique identifier assigned by the Ministry of Justice</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Authorized Stamp</h4>

        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Signature Authority</h4>
          <p>Legal right to certify translation accuracy</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>The Official Stamp & Signature</h3>

      <p>
        Every MOJ-approved translation carries specific identifying marks. The translator's stamp typically includes
        their name (in Arabic and English), MOJ registration number, phrase indicating MOJ approval, and contact
        information.
      </p>

      <div class="pullquote">
        <p>
          The stamp and signature serve as the translator's personal guarantee—they're putting their professional
          reputation and registration on the line by certifying the accuracy of the translation.

      <h2>Understanding Different Court Systems</h2>

      <p>
        The UAE has multiple court systems with different requirements. Understanding which jurisdiction applies
        to your documents is essential for proper translation.
