  {
    question: "What is the difference between Nikah Nama and NADRA marriage certificate?",
    answer: "Nikah Nama is the original Islamic marriage contract issued by Union Council. NADRA marriage certificate is a computerized version registered in Pakistan's national database. Both are valid, but some UAE entities specifically request the original Nikah Nama. For family visa applications, either is typically accepted if properly attested."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Pakistan a Hague Convention country?",
    answer: "No. Pakistan is NOT a member of the Hague Apostille Convention. This means Pakistani documents require the full attestation chain: Pakistan MOFA attestation, UAE Embassy attestation in Pakistan, UAE MOFA attestation, then MOJ-certified translation in Dubai. The process takes longer than Hague member countries."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does Pakistani Nikah Nama translation cost in Dubai?",
    answer: "MOJ-certified Nikah Nama translation starts from AED 150. Complex documents with handwritten Urdu text or poor legibility may cost more. The attestation chain (Pakistan MOFA + UAE Embassy + UAE MOFA) typically costs between AED 300-500 depending on service provider. Total process including attestation and translation ranges AED 500-800."
  },
  {
    question: "Why does GDRFA reject some Nikah Nama translations?",
    answer: "Common rejection reasons: missing attestation stamps, name spelling doesn't match passport, illegible handwritten Urdu text, missing witness information in translation, or using NADRA certificate when original Nikah Nama was specifically requested. Name consistency is the most frequent issue—even small differences like 'Mohammad' vs 'Mohammed' cause rejection."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use NADRA marriage certificate instead of Nikah Nama?",
    answer: "It depends on the UAE entity's requirements. GDRFA typically accepts either for spouse visa if properly attested. However, some banks and courts specifically request the original Nikah Nama. NADRA certificate is easier to process (computerized, clear text) but verify requirements before proceeding. We advise based on your specific use case."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I get Nikah Nama attested from UAE Embassy in Pakistan?",
    answer: "After Pakistan MOFA attestation, submit your Nikah Nama to UAE Embassy in Islamabad or UAE Consulate in Karachi. Required: original document with Pakistan MOFA stamp, passport copy, application form, and fees. Processing takes 3-7 working days. Many use attestation agencies in Pakistan to handle the entire chain, which costs more but saves travel time."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my Nikah Nama has handwritten Urdu that is hard to read?",
    answer: "Illegible handwriting is a common challenge with older Nikah Nama documents. If text is unclear, our translator contacts you to verify details. In severe cases, you may need to obtain a NADRA computerized certificate as a clearer alternative. Courts and GDRFA understand Nikah Nama legibility issues and may accept NADRA certificates if originals are unreadable."
  },
  {
    question: "Does Mehr amount need to be translated?",
    answer: "Yes. The Mehr (dower) amount must be included in the translation as it's a legal component of the Nikah contract. We translate the amount as stated, whether in Pakistani Rupees or other currency. GDRFA doesn't verify Mehr amounts but includes it as part of the complete document translation for legal accuracy."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the complete attestation and translation process take?",
    answer: "If starting in Pakistan: Pakistan MOFA (1-2 weeks), UAE Embassy Pakistan (1 week), shipping to UAE (3-5 days), UAE MOFA (2-3 days), MOJ translation (1-2 days). Total: 3-4 weeks minimum. If your document is already attested and in Dubai, translation takes 24-48 hours. Express same-day translation available for urgent cases."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my name spelling on Nikah Nama doesn't match my passport?",
    answer: "This is a serious issue causing visa rejection. If the mismatch is minor (transliteration variation like 'Mohammad' vs 'Mohammed'), obtain a name equivalence letter from Pakistan Embassy in UAE confirming both spellings refer to the same person. For major discrepancies, you may need to correct your passport or obtain a <a href='/personal/vital-records/birth/'>birth certificate</a> with the correct spelling."

      <p class="hero-intro">You are one of 2.09 million Pakistanis living in the UAE. When sponsoring a spouse, opening joint accounts, or registering property, your Nikah Nama proves the marriage. The challenge: Pakistan is not a Hague Convention member. Your Nikah Nama needs the full attestation chain before it reaches Dubai for MOJ-certified translation.</p>

      <h2>What Is a Nikah Nama?</h2>
      <p>The Nikah Nama is your Islamic marriage contract. In Pakistan, it serves as the legal and religious record of your marriage. It's issued by the Nikah Registrar at your local Union Council after the marriage ceremony.</p>

      <p>The document is legally binding under Pakistani law. It contains essential details that UAE authorities verify when processing visa and banking applications.</p>

      <div class="document-details">
        <h3>What a Nikah Nama Contains:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Full names of bride and groom</li>
          <li>Father's names for both parties</li>
          <li>Witnesses (shahid) with their details</li>
          <li>Mehr (dower amount) agreed upon</li>
          <li>Date of marriage (Islamic and Gregorian calendar)</li>
          <li>Location where Nikah was performed</li>
          <li>Nikah Registrar or Qazi signature and stamp</li>
          <li>Union Council registration number</li>
          <li>Any special conditions agreed in the contract</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>Most Nikah Nama documents are written in Urdu. Some contain Arabic religious phrases and Quranic references. Older certificates often have handwritten sections that can be difficult to read.</p>

      <div class="comparison-box">
        <h3>Nikah Nama vs NADRA Marriage Certificate</h3>
        <p>NADRA (National Database and Registration Authority) issues a computerized marriage certificate. It contains the same information as Nikah Nama but in typed format registered in Pakistan's national database.</p>
        <p><strong>Key difference:</strong> NADRA certificate is easier to read and process. However, some UAE entities specifically request the original Nikah Nama because it's the primary Islamic marriage document. We advise which version you need based on your use case.</p>

      <h2>Pakistan's Attestation Status: NOT a Hague Member</h2>

      <div class="critical-warning">
        <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>
        <div>
          <strong>Critical Fact:</strong> Pakistan is NOT a member of the Hague Apostille Convention. This means your Nikah Nama cannot use the simplified apostille process. It requires the complete embassy attestation chain—a longer, more complex procedure than Hague member countries.
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Countries like India, UK, USA, and Philippines joined the Hague Convention. Their documents only need a single apostille stamp. Pakistani documents need four separate authentication steps before they're accepted in Dubai.</p>

      <p>This is not optional. GDRFA, banks, and UAE courts will reject Pakistani marriage documents without complete attestation. No shortcuts exist.</p>

          <h3>Family Visa and Spouse Sponsorship</h3>
          <p>GDRFA requires attested and translated Nikah Nama for spouse residency visa applications. Your sponsor's salary must meet minimum thresholds. The marriage certificate proves the legal relationship allowing sponsorship.</p>
          <p><strong>Common issue:</strong> Name spelling on Nikah Nama must exactly match both passports. Character-by-character matching is strict.</p>

          <div class="solution">

            <h3>Missing or Incomplete Attestation Stamps</h3>
            <p>Your Nikah Nama needs all four stamps: Union Council, Pakistan MOFA, UAE Embassy Pakistan, and UAE MOFA. Missing even one stamp causes immediate rejection.</p>
            <p><strong>How to avoid:</strong> Before submitting documents, verify all stamps are present and clearly visible. Check that each stamp is recent and hasn't faded. Take photos at each attestation stage.</p>

            <p>This is the single most common reason for spouse visa rejection. GDRFA's system performs character-by-character matching. "Mohammad Ali" on Nikah Nama versus "Mohammed Ali" on passport flags a mismatch.</p>
            <p><strong>How to avoid:</strong> Compare both spouses' names on Nikah Nama against their passports before starting attestation. If there's any difference, obtain a name equivalence letter from Pakistan Embassy UAE before applying.</p>

            <p>Some UAE entities specifically request the original Nikah Nama issued by Union Council. Submitting NADRA certificate instead causes rejection even if both are valid marriage proofs.</p>
            <p><strong>How to avoid:</strong> When receiving requirements, ask specifically: "Do you need the original Nikah Nama or will NADRA certificate work?" Clarify before starting expensive attestation process.</p>

            <p><strong>How to avoid:</strong> If your Nikah Nama has poor legibility, obtain a fresh certified copy from Union Council or get NADRA computerized certificate. High-resolution scans help translators work with borderline cases.</p>

            <p><strong>How to avoid:</strong> Ensure your translation includes complete witness information: names, father's names, CNIC numbers if shown. Our translations include all details from the original Nikah Nama.</p>

            <h3>Outdated Attestation Stamps</h3>
            <p>While attestation doesn't technically "expire," some UAE banks and visa centers prefer recent attestation (within 6-12 months). Very old attestation from 5+ years ago may face additional scrutiny.</p>
            <p><strong>How to avoid:</strong> If your Nikah Nama has old attestation stamps, check with the specific UAE entity whether they accept it or require fresh attestation. Many do accept older stamps if clear and verifiable.</p>

          Many Pakistani families use attestation agencies in Islamabad or Karachi that handle the complete chain for a flat fee. This costs more (PKR 8,000-15,000) but saves multiple trips and handles document tracking. Contact us for recommended agency referrals.
