const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is MOJ-certified translation?",
    answer: "MOJ-certified translation is performed by a translator licensed by the UAE Ministry of Justice. The translated document bears the translator's official MOJ stamp, signature, and license number. It is required for courts, most government ministries, and official proceedings. You can verify any MOJ translator's license through the MOJ Hotline 800 333333."
  },
  {
    question: "What is certified translation without MOJ?",
    answer: "Certified translation is performed by a professional translator who provides a signed declaration of accuracy, but does not hold an MOJ license. This is accepted by many private companies, banks, HR departments, and some free zone authorities. It is less expensive than MOJ-certified translation."
  },
  {
    question: "What is notarized translation?",
    answer: "Notarized translation is a certified translation that has been additionally verified by a Notary Public. The notary confirms the translator's identity and signature, not the translation quality. Some foreign embassies and specific legal contexts require notarization on top of certification."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I always need MOJ translation for government submissions?",
    answer: "Not always. DIFC and ADGM accept English documents without Arabic translation for most filings. Abu Dhabi Judicial Department exempts certain financial documents (bank statements, invoices) from translation under Circular No. 8 of 2023. And some MOHRE processes accept bilingual forms without separate translation. Check the authority-specific table in this guide."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use a certified translation from my home country in the UAE?",
    answer: "No, for government and court submissions. UAE authorities require translation by a UAE MOJ-licensed translator. A certified translation from the UK, Germany, India, or any other country will be rejected by GDRFA, MOHRE, courts, and MOFA. For private-sector use (HR, banks), some entities may accept foreign certified translations, but this varies."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does MOJ translation cost compared to certified?",
    answer: "MOJ-certified translation starts at AED 150 per document. Certified translation (without MOJ) may start lower, typically AED 100-150 per document. The price difference is modest, but if you only need certified translation, there is no reason to pay for MOJ certification. We tell you which type you need before quoting."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I'm not sure which translation type I need?",
    answer: "Send your document and tell us where you plan to submit it. We will tell you exactly which translation type is required — MOJ, certified, or notarized — based on the receiving authority. If certified is sufficient, we won't charge you for MOJ. WhatsApp us at +971 50 862 0217."
  },
  {
    question: "Does DIFC require Arabic translation?",
    answer: "DIFC Courts operate in English and accept English documents for filings within DIFC jurisdiction. However, if you need to enforce a DIFC judgment in mainland Dubai Courts, Arabic MOJ-certified translation is required. Dubai Law No. 2 of 2025 codified this requirement."
  },
  {
    question: "What about documents for banks and private companies?",
    answer: "Most UAE banks and private companies accept certified translation without MOJ stamp. However, some banks have stricter policies and may request MOJ certification. Check with the specific institution before ordering translation. When in doubt, MOJ-certified covers all bases."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need translation for documents already in Arabic?",
    answer: "No. If your original document is in Arabic, no translation is needed for UAE authorities. If the authority also requires English (like some DIFC or ADGM filings), you would need Arabic-to-English certified translation. Most UAE proceedings only require Arabic."

        Every translation company tells you to get MOJ-certified translation for everything. That is not always true. Some authorities accept certified translation without MOJ. Some accept English documents with no Arabic translation at all. This guide tells you exactly what you need, sorted by where you are submitting.

        There are three types of translation in the UAE: MOJ-certified, certified (without MOJ), and notarized. Each serves a different purpose. Paying for MOJ when you only need certified wastes money. Submitting certified when MOJ is required wastes time. This guide eliminates the guessing.

      <!-- When You DON'T Need MOJ -->
      <h2 id="dont-need-moj">When You DON'T Need MOJ Certification</h2>

      <p>
        Here are the common situations where certified translation (without MOJ) is sufficient:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Employment contracts for private companies:</strong> Your employer's HR department typically accepts <a href="/blog/authenticated-translation-moj-vs-certified/">certified translation</a> of your academic documents.</li>
        <li><strong>Bank account opening:</strong> Most UAE banks accept certified translation of supporting documents. Some banks are stricter — always confirm first.</li>
        <li><strong>Free zone company formation:</strong> JAFZA, DMCC, Dubai Internet City, and most other free zones accept English documents. Arabic translation is rarely required for internal processes.</li>
        <li><strong>DIFC and ADGM filings:</strong> Both operate in English. No Arabic translation needed unless you are enforcing across jurisdictions.</li>
        <li><strong>Insurance claims:</strong> Certified translation is generally accepted for medical reports and supporting documents.</li>
        <li><strong>School enrollment:</strong> KHDA-regulated schools in Dubai typically accept certified translation of academic records.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <a href="/resources/moj-vs-certified/">Our detailed MOJ vs Certified comparison</a> covers the technical differences between the two types.
      </p>

      <!-- When You MUST Have MOJ -->
      <h2 id="must-have-moj">When MOJ Certification Is Mandatory</h2>

      <p>
        No shortcuts here. These submissions require MOJ-certified Arabic translation:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Any court filing</strong> — Dubai Courts, Abu Dhabi Courts, Federal Courts, Sharjah Courts</li>
        <li><strong>Visa and residency applications</strong> — GDRFA, ICP</li>
        <li><strong>Work permit applications</strong> — MOHRE, Tasheel</li>
        <li><strong>Document attestation</strong> — MOFA attestation chain</li>
        <li><strong>Degree equivalency</strong> — <a href="/resources/mohesr-equivalency/">MOHESR Certificate of Recognition</a></li>
        <li><strong>Property transactions</strong> — DLD (Dubai Land Department), DMT (Abu Dhabi)</li>
        <li><strong>Wills and estate matters</strong> — <a href="/legal/wills/">ADJD will registration</a>, probate proceedings</li>
        <li><strong>Criminal matters</strong> — All criminal proceedings in the UAE</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The legal basis: Federal Decree-Law No. 22 of 2022 regulates the translation profession. Only MOJ-registered translators may practice, and courts may reject translations from unregistered translators. Federal Decree-Law No. 42 of 2022, Article 48 requires certified Arabic translation for all foreign-language documents submitted as evidence.
      </p>

      <!-- The ADJD Exception -->
      <h2 id="adjd-exception">The Abu Dhabi Exception: ADJD Circular No. 8</h2>

      <p>
        Abu Dhabi Judicial Department issued Circular No. 8 of 2023, which exempts certain documents from translation:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Bank statements with primarily numerical content</li>
        <li>Invoices where the key information (amounts, dates, parties) is clear from context</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This exemption applies only to ADJD proceedings in Abu Dhabi. Dubai Courts, Sharjah Courts, and Federal Courts still require full translation of all documents, including bank statements. Do not assume this exemption applies outside Abu Dhabi.
      </p>
