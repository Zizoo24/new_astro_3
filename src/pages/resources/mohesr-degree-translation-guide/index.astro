const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Do I need MOHESR equivalency for my degree?",
    answer: "It depends on your profession and employer. Equivalency is mandatory for healthcare, engineering, teaching, government, Golden Visa, and law. It is NOT required for most private-sector roles unless your employer specifically demands it. Graduates of CAA-licensed UAE universities are also exempt."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between attestation and MOHESR equivalency?",
    answer: "Attestation verifies your document is genuine (handled by MOFA). Equivalency evaluates whether your degree meets UAE academic standards (handled by MOHESR). Attestation is a prerequisite for equivalency — you need attestation first. Many people complete attestation and think they are done."
  },
  {
    question: "Does my degree certificate need Arabic translation for MOHESR?",
    answer: "Yes, if your degree is not in Arabic or English. MOHESR requires MOJ-certified Arabic translation. Translations done abroad — even German sworn translations or UK certified translations — are rejected. Only UAE MOJ-certified translations are accepted."
  },
  {
    question: "Can online or distance learning degrees get MOHESR equivalency?",
    answer: "Since 2023, some distance learning degrees are accepted if properly accredited. However, degrees in medicine, engineering, and law are excluded from distance learning recognition. Check whether your specific program qualifies before applying."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I miss the MOHESR 7-day document deadline?",
    answer: "Auto-rejection with no refund. If MOHESR requests additional documents, you have exactly 7 days to respond. Missing this deadline means your application is automatically rejected and you must reapply and pay the fee again."
  },
  {
    question: "My university is accredited by HEC/UGC. Does UAE recognize it?",
    answer: "Not necessarily. Home-country accreditation (HEC in Pakistan, UGC in India) does NOT automatically mean UAE recognition. MOHESR maintains its own list of recognized institutions. An accredited university in your home country may still be unrecognized by MOHESR."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does MOHESR equivalency take?",
    answer: "Typically 2-4 weeks if all documents are correct and complete. If MOHESR requests additional documents, the 7-day response window starts and can add time. Rejected applications require full resubmission."
  },
  {
    question: "Is MOHESR equivalency the same as the old MOE equivalency?",
    answer: "Yes. Since November 2024, degree equivalency officially transferred from the Ministry of Education (MOE) to MOHESR. It is now called a 'Certificate of Recognition' rather than 'Equivalency Certificate.' The process is the same."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need MOHESR equivalency for Golden Visa?",
    answer: "Yes. Golden Visa applicants with foreign degrees typically need MOHESR recognition. This is separate from the degree attestation that GDRFA requires. Both are needed — attestation for the visa application and equivalency for the qualification verification."
  },
  {
    question: "What documents do I need for MOHESR equivalency application?",
    answer: "You need your attested degree certificate with Arabic translation, academic transcripts with Arabic translation, passport copy, and any additional documents MOHESR may request for your specific degree type. All translations must be MOJ-certified in the UAE."
  }

        MOHESR degree equivalency — now called "Certificate of Recognition" — confuses almost everyone. People mix it up with attestation. They assume home-country accreditation means UAE recognition. They miss the 7-day document deadline and lose their application fee. This guide covers who actually needs equivalency, what documents require Arabic translation, and the five predictable reasons applications get rejected.

      <h2>Do You Actually Need MOHESR Equivalency?</h2>
      <p>Not everyone does. Here is the clear breakdown.</p>

      <div class="need-grid">
        <div class="need-card need-card--yes">
          <h3>Equivalency Required</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Healthcare professionals</strong> — doctors, nurses, pharmacists, dentists (also need <a href="/resources/dha-post-licensing-documents/">DHA licensing</a>)</li>
            <li><strong>Engineers</strong> — for Society of Engineers registration</li>
            <li><strong>Teachers</strong> — for KHDA or ADEK licensing</li>
            <li><strong>Government/semi-government</strong> — all positions</li>
            <li><strong><a href="/services/golden-visa-translation/">Golden Visa</a> applicants</strong> — foreign degree holders</li>
            <li><strong>Legal professionals</strong> — lawyers, legal consultants</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="need-card need-card--no">
          <h3>Equivalency NOT Required</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Private sector roles</strong> — unless employer specifically demands it</li>
            <li><strong>Graduates of UAE universities</strong> — those licensed by the Commission for Academic Accreditation (CAA)</li>
            <li><strong>Free zone employees</strong> — many free zones do not require MOHESR (check with your zone)</li>

        <h4>Attestation Is NOT Equivalency</h4>
        <p>Attestation (MOFA) verifies your document is genuine. Equivalency (MOHESR) evaluates whether your degree meets UAE academic standards. You need attestation first — it is a prerequisite. Many complete attestation and assume they are done. They are not. These are two separate processes with different outcomes.</p>

    <div class="container container--narrow">
      <h2>The 5 Reasons MOHESR Rejects Applications</h2>
      <p>These are predictable and preventable. Knowing them in advance saves weeks and application fees.</p>

      <div class="rejection-cards">
        <div class="rejection-card">
          <span class="rejection-num">1</span>
          <div>
            <h3>Unrecognized University</h3>
            <p>The most common rejection. Your university may be fully accredited in your home country — by HEC (Pakistan), UGC (India), or equivalent bodies — and still be unrecognized by MOHESR. UAE maintains its own recognition list.</p>
            <p class="rejection-action">Check MOHESR's recognized institution list before applying. If your university is not listed, the application will be rejected regardless of how good your documents are.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="rejection-card">
          <span class="rejection-num">2</span>
          <div>
            <h3>Distance Learning or Online Degree</h3>
            <p>A 2023 policy change allows some accredited distance learning degrees. However, degrees in medicine, engineering, and law are permanently excluded from distance learning recognition.</p>
            <p class="rejection-action">If your degree was earned online or via distance learning, verify that your specific program qualifies under the 2023 policy before submitting.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="rejection-card">
          <span class="rejection-num">3</span>
          <div>
            <h3>Missing or Incomplete Documents</h3>
            <p>This includes failing to respond to MOHESR's request for additional documents within their <strong>7-day deadline</strong>. Missing this deadline triggers automatic rejection with no refund. MOHESR does not extend this window.</p>
            <p class="rejection-action">Prepare all possible documents before applying. Keep your email and phone accessible during the review period. Respond to any MOHESR request immediately.</p>
          </div>

        <div class="rejection-card">
          <span class="rejection-num">4</span>
          <div>
            <h3>Name Discrepancies</h3>
            <p>Even minor transliteration differences between your passport and academic documents trigger rejection. "Mohamed" vs "Mohammed," "Ahmed" vs "Ahmad," or different ordering of family name components are all flagged.</p>
            <p class="rejection-action">Ensure your <a href="/personal/academic/degree/">degree certificate</a> translation matches your passport name exactly. Alert your translator to any name variations so they can note them properly.</p>

            <h3>Translation Issues</h3>
            <p>Two common translation problems: (1) documents without MOJ-certified Arabic translation, and (2) translations done abroad. German "sworn" translations, UK certified translations, and any non-UAE translation are rejected by MOHESR.</p>
            <p class="rejection-action">Only submit translations from <a href="/legal-translation-dubai/">UAE MOJ-certified translators</a>. Foreign translations — regardless of certification in their country — are not accepted.</p>

    <div class="container container--narrow">
      <h2>Documents That Need Arabic Translation</h2>
      <p>If your academic documents are in any language other than Arabic or English, they need MOJ-certified Arabic translation for MOHESR submission.</p>

      <h3>Required for All Applications</h3>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li><strong><a href="/personal/academic/degree/">Degree certificate</a></strong> — fully attested, then translated</li>
        <li><strong>Academic transcripts</strong> — complete transcript, not a summary</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>May Be Required (Case-by-Case)</h3>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li><strong>Course descriptions</strong> — MOHESR sometimes requests details of specific courses</li>
        <li><strong>Professional license</strong> — for regulated professions</li>
        <li><strong>Internship or training certificates</strong> — for medical and engineering degrees</li>

        <h4>Foreign Translations Are Rejected</h4>
        <p>MOHESR only accepts translations from UAE MOJ-certified translators. Even professionally certified translations from Germany, UK, India, or any other country are not accepted.

            <h3>Complete Attestation Chain First</h3>
            <p>Your degree must be attested before MOHESR will accept it. The chain depends on your country:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Hague countries</strong> (India, USA, UK, Philippines, Bangladesh): Notarize &rarr; Apostille &rarr; <a href="/services/attestation/">UAE MOFA</a></li>
