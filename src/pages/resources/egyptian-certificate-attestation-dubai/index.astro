  {
    question: "Is Egypt a member of the Hague Apostille Convention?",
    answer: "No, Egypt is not a member of the Hague Apostille Convention. This means Egyptian documents cannot use the simplified apostille process. You must complete the full attestation chain: Egyptian MOFA, UAE Embassy in Cairo, and UAE MOFA."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does Egyptian certificate attestation take?",
    answer: "The complete chain typically takes 2-4 weeks. Egyptian MOFA attestation takes 3-5 business days, UAE Embassy in Cairo takes 5-7 business days, and UAE MOFA takes 1-3 business days once the document arrives in the UAE."
  },
  {
    question: "Do Al-Azhar University degrees need special attestation?",
    answer: "Yes. Al-Azhar degrees require attestation from Al-Azhar Sheikh's office first, then Egyptian MOFA, before UAE Embassy attestation. This adds an extra step compared to civil university degrees. Skipping this step is a common rejection reason."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between MOJ and certified translation for Egyptians?",
    answer: "MOJ legal translation is required for courts, ministries, and government entities like GDRFA. Certified translation is sufficient for private companies, banks, and HR departments. Using the wrong type causes rejection or unnecessary expense."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I translate my Egyptian marriage certificate in the UAE?",
    answer: "Yes. After completing the full attestation chain, you can translate your Egyptian marriage certificate in the UAE. We provide MOJ-certified translation with 60-minute delivery for standard documents."
  },
  {
    question: "Which Egyptian documents need attestation for UAE family visa?",
    answer: "You need: attested and translated marriage certificate, attested and translated birth certificates for all children, passport copies, salary certificate or employment contract, and tenancy contract. All Egyptian documents need the full attestation chain before translation."
  },
  {
    question: "Is an Egyptian police clearance certificate accepted in UAE?",
    answer: "Yes, after full attestation. Egyptian police clearance (issued by Ministry of Interior) must be attested by Egyptian MOFA and UAE Embassy. It should be no older than 6 months when submitted to UAE authorities."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does Egyptian document translation cost in UAE?",
    answer: "MOJ legal translation starts from AED 150 per standard document. Marriage certificates and academic degrees may cost more depending on page count. We provide instant quotes via WhatsApp after reviewing your document."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I start the attestation process from inside the UAE?",
    answer: "Partially. Egyptian MOFA and UAE Embassy attestation in Cairo require the document to be in Egypt. You can authorize someone in Egypt or use an agency. Once the document arrives in UAE, we handle MOFA attestation and translation."
  },
  {
    question: "What causes Egyptian document rejection in UAE?",
    answer: "Common reasons: missing UAE Embassy attestation (most common), wrong attestation sequence, name spelling differences between documents, expired attestation, and documents from non-recognized private institutions. Always verify the attestation chain is complete."

      <h2>Egypt's Attestation Status: Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>Egypt is not a member of the Hague Apostille Convention. This is the most important fact to understand when preparing your documents.</p>

      <p>Countries in the Hague Convention can use a simplified one-step apostille process. India, UK, USA, Canada, and Philippines use apostilles. Their documents skip the embassy attestation step entirely.</p>

      <p>Egyptian documents cannot use apostilles. Every Egyptian certificate needs the full diplomatic attestation chain. This makes the process longer and more complex than for Hague member countries.</p>

      <div class="info-box">
        <i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i>
        <div>
          <strong>UAE is also not a Hague member.</strong> This means documents traveling between Egypt and UAE must follow the traditional embassy attestation route. There are no shortcuts.
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>The full process involves multiple government offices in two countries. Understanding each step prevents costly mistakes and delays.</p>

      <h2>Translation Considerations for Egyptian Documents</h2>
      <p>Egyptian documents present specific translation challenges. Experienced translators familiar with Egyptian formatting prevent rejection.</p>

      <div class="translation-issues">
        <div class="issue-card">
          <h3><i class="fas fa-language"></i> Egyptian Arabic vs. Standard Arabic</h3>
          <p>Egyptian official documents use Modern Standard Arabic, but formatting and terminology differ from Gulf Arabic standards. Translators unfamiliar with Egyptian conventions may misinterpret document structure.</p>
          <p>Egyptian marriage contracts and civil registry documents use specific legal phrasing. Direct word-for-word translation without understanding Egyptian legal terminology causes problems.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="issue-card">
          <h3><i class="fas fa-signature"></i> Name Transliteration Challenges</h3>
          <p>Egyptian names follow specific patterns: first name, father's name, grandfather's name, family name. Western transliteration varies significantly.</p>
          <p>Example: محمد عبد الرحمن can become "Mohamed Abdel Rahman," "Muhammad Abd Al-Rahman," or "Mohammed Abdelrahman." Your translation must match your passport exactly.</p>
          <div class="solution-box">
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Provide your passport copy to the translator before starting. Insist they use your exact passport spelling for all names, even if they prefer different transliteration.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="issue-card">
          <h3><i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i> Date Format Differences</h3>
          <p>Egypt uses day/month/year format like UAE. However, older Egyptian documents may include Hijri dates alongside Gregorian dates. Some very old documents show only Hijri dates.</p>
          <p>Translators must convert Hijri dates accurately to Gregorian calendar while noting both dates in the translation. Date conversion errors cause age verification problems for birth certificates.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="issue-card">
          <h3><i class="fas fa-id-card"></i> Egyptian National ID vs. Passport Numbers</h3>
          <p>Egyptian documents reference the 14-digit National ID number. UAE entities need passport numbers. Your translation should include both identifiers when present in the original document.</p>
          <p>Many Egyptian documents don't show passport numbers. The translation should note "passport number not shown on original document" to prevent questions later.</p>

      <h2>Practical Tips for Egyptian Expats</h2>
      <p>Based on common issues we see from Egyptian clients, here's what helps:</p>

      <div class="tips-grid">
        <div class="tip-card">
          <i class="fas fa-plane-departure"></i>
          <h3>Attest During Egypt Visits</h3>
          <p>If you're visiting Egypt, bring all documents you might need for attestation. Getting attestation done in person in Egypt is faster and cheaper than coordinating remotely.</p>
          <p>Even if you don't need the documents now, attested documents remain valid. This saves time for future applications.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
          <i class="fas fa-copy"></i>
          <h3>Keep Certified Copies</h3>
          <p>After attestation, make certified copies of your fully-attested documents before submitting originals anywhere. Some entities keep originals, leaving you without backup.</p>
          <p>Certified copies from a typing center cost AED 10-20 and prevent needing to re-attest if originals are lost.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
          <i class="fas fa-university"></i>
          <h3>Verify University Recognition</h3>
          <p>Before paying for degree attestation, check that your Egyptian university is recognized by the Supreme Council of Universities. Visit their website or call their verification hotline.</p>
          <p>Non-recognized universities waste your attestation fees. The document will be rejected regardless of proper attestation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
          <i class="fab fa-whatsapp"></i>
          <h3>WhatsApp Documents First</h3>
          <p>Before paying for translation, send document photos via WhatsApp. We review for attestation completeness, potential name issues, and document validity.</p>
          <p>This free check catches problems before you pay. We tell you exactly what's missing or what might cause rejection.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
          <i class="fas fa-file-invoice"></i>
          <h3>Request Itemized Quotes</h3>
          <p>When using attestation agents in Egypt, request itemized quotes showing Egyptian MOFA fees, UAE Embassy fees, and service charges separately. This prevents price inflation.</p>
          <p>Know the official government fees before agreeing to agent rates. Agents typically charge 200-300% markup on government fees.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
          <i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i>
          <h3>Get Fresh Police Clearance</h3>
          <p>Egyptian police clearance (Fiche) has a 6-month validity. If you're planning to use it for visa applications, get it issued close to your application date.</p>
          <p>Old police clearance certificates, even if properly attested, will be rejected. The issue date matters more than attestation date.</p>
