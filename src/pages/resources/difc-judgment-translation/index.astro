    question: "Do all DIFC judgments need Arabic translation for enforcement in Dubai Courts?",
    answer: "Yes, if you are enforcing a DIFC judgment in Dubai Courts under Dubai Law No. 2 of 2025, you need MOJ-certified Arabic translation of the judgment and supporting documents. DIFC Courts operate in English under common law. Dubai Courts operate in Arabic under civil law. The translation bridges the jurisdictional and linguistic gap between these two systems."
  },
  {
    question: "What is Dubai Law No. 2 of 2025 and why does it matter for DIFC judgments?",
    answer: "Dubai Law No. 2 of 2025 establishes the framework for judicial cooperation between DIFC Courts and Dubai Courts. It allows DIFC judgments to be enforced in Dubai Courts without re-litigation. However, the law requires all DIFC documents to be translated into Arabic by an MOJ-licensed translator. This ensures Dubai Courts judges can review the case in Arabic, the official language of UAE civil courts."
  },
  {
    question: "Which DIFC documents need MOJ translation for Dubai Courts enforcement?",
    answer: "The core documents are: the final judgment or order, the statement of claim or petition, the statement of defense, all witness statements referenced in the judgment, and any exhibits or evidence cited by the judge. You also need translation of any procedural orders relevant to the enforcement. Your lawyer will advise on the specific list based on your case."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to translate a DIFC judgment for Dubai Courts?",
    answer: "A standard 10-15 page DIFC judgment takes 3-5 business days for MOJ translation. Complex judgments with technical legal analysis or extensive exhibits can take 7-10 days. Rush service (48 hours) is available for urgent enforcement deadlines. Translation must be completed before filing your enforcement application in Dubai Courts."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use the same translation if I am enforcing in both Dubai Courts and another emirate?",
    answer: "Yes, MOJ translation is valid across all UAE courts. If you are enforcing a DIFC judgment in Sharjah Courts or Abu Dhabi Courts, the same MOJ-certified Arabic translation applies. You do not need separate translations for each emirate. This is one of the benefits of the unified MOJ licensing system across the UAE."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if the Arabic translation contains a legal terminology error?",
    answer: "Dubai Courts may reject the enforcement application or request clarification. Common law terms do not always have direct Arabic equivalents in civil law. An experienced legal translator ensures proper terminology mapping. If an error is identified, we correct and restamp the document at no additional cost. Pre-enforcement review with your lawyer helps catch issues before filing."
  },
  {
    question: "Do ADGM judgments also need Arabic translation for Dubai Courts enforcement?",
    answer: "Yes, ADGM Courts also operate in English under common law. If you are enforcing an ADGM judgment in Dubai Courts, you need MOJ-certified Arabic translation of the judgment and supporting documents. The same Dubai Law No. 2 of 2025 framework applies. ADGM and DIFC judgments follow identical translation requirements for mainland UAE court enforcement."
  },
  {
    question: "What DIFC documents do NOT need translation for Dubai Courts enforcement?",
    answer: "Internal DIFC court administrative correspondence, case management conference notes not cited in the judgment, and settlement negotiation records do not need translation. Only documents that form part of the enforceable record require MOJ translation. Your enforcement lawyer will confirm which documents Dubai Courts require. This saves time and translation costs by focusing only on essential documents."

        <h2>Why DIFC Judgments Need Translation for Dubai Courts</h2>

        <p>
          DIFC Courts operate entirely in English under common law principles. Dubai Courts operate entirely in Arabic under UAE civil law. When you need to enforce a DIFC judgment against assets or parties in mainland Dubai, you are crossing from one legal system into another.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dubai Courts judges cannot review English-language DIFC judgments directly. Arabic is the official language of UAE courts under Federal Law. MOJ-certified translation converts your DIFC judgment into a legally valid Arabic document that Dubai Courts can process and enforce.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is not a bureaucratic formality. The translation requirement ensures Dubai Courts judges fully understand the DIFC judgment before ordering enforcement actions like asset seizure or bank account freezing.
        </p>

        <h3>The Legal Framework: Dubai Law No. 2 of 2025</h3>

        <p>
          Dubai Law No. 2 of 2025 on Judicial Cooperation Between Dubai Courts and DIFC Courts revolutionized cross-jurisdiction enforcement. Before this law, enforcing DIFC judgments in Dubai Courts required full re-litigation. Now, DIFC judgments are recognized and enforced without re-examining the merits.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, the law includes one critical requirement: all DIFC documents must be translated into Arabic by an <a href="/resources/moj-vs-certified/">MOJ-licensed translator</a>. This ensures Dubai Courts can verify the judgment meets UAE public policy standards before enforcement.
        </p>

        <p>
          The same law applies to <a href="/resources/adgm-translation-requirements/">ADGM Courts judgments</a>. Both DIFC and ADGM operate as common law jurisdictions within the UAE but separate from the civil law mainland court system.
        </p>

        <h2>What Documents Need Translation</h2>

        <p>
          Not every page from your DIFC case file needs translation. Dubai Courts focus on documents that form the enforceable record. Your enforcement lawyer will confirm the exact list, but these documents are typically required.
        </p>

        <h3>Core DIFC Documents for Translation</h3>

        <p>
          The final judgment or order is mandatory. This includes the judgment text, the operative orders, and any schedules or annexes referenced in the judgment. If the DIFC judgment includes cost orders or interest calculations, those sections need translation as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          The statement of claim or petition that initiated the DIFC case needs translation. Dubai Courts want to understand the original cause of action. Similarly, the statement of defense and any counterclaims filed by the defendant require translation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Witness statements referenced in the DIFC judgment need translation if the Dubai Courts judge wants to verify factual findings. This is common in complex commercial disputes where credibility determinations matter.
        </p>

        <h3>Supporting Documents and Evidence</h3>

        <p>
          Any exhibits or evidence cited by the DIFC judge in reaching the decision may need translation. This includes contracts, emails, financial records, or expert reports that formed the basis of the judgment. Dubai Courts typically do not require translation of every exhibit, only those central to the judgment.
        </p>

        <p>
          Procedural orders relevant to enforcement need translation. For example, if the DIFC judgment includes an injunction or asset freezing order, Dubai Courts need the Arabic translation to understand the enforcement scope.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="/legal/litigation/verdict/">Court verdicts</a> and <a href="/legal/litigation/arbitration/">arbitration awards</a> enforced through DIFC Courts also follow the same translation requirements if you are moving enforcement to Dubai Courts.
        </p>

        <h3>What You Do NOT Need to Translate</h3>

        <p>
          Internal DIFC court administrative correspondence does not need translation. Case management conference notes, scheduling orders, and procedural directions not cited in the judgment can be excluded. This saves time and cost.
        </p>

        <p>
          Settlement negotiation records, mediation transcripts, and without prejudice correspondence do not need translation unless the DIFC judgment specifically references them. Dubai Courts focus on the enforceable judgment, not the negotiation history.
        </p>

        <p>
          Draft pleadings, amended claims, or superseded documents do not need translation. Only the final, operative versions of pleadings that the DIFC judge relied upon require MOJ certification.
        </p>

        <h2>The Enforcement Process: Step by Step</h2>

        <p>
          Enforcing a DIFC judgment in Dubai Courts involves several stages. Translation happens early in the process, before you file your enforcement application.
        </p>

        <h3>Stage 1: Document Identification and Translation</h3>

        <p>
          Your enforcement lawyer reviews the DIFC case file and identifies which documents Dubai Courts will require. You send these documents to an <a href="/legal-translation-dubai/">MOJ-licensed legal translator</a>. We translate each document into Arabic and certify the translation with the MOJ stamp and translator signature.
        </p>

        <p>
          Translation takes 3-5 business days for a standard judgment. Complex judgments with specialized financial or technical terminology may take 7-10 days. Rush service is available if you have urgent enforcement deadlines.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once translation is complete, you receive the original English documents plus the MOJ-certified Arabic translations. Both versions are submitted to Dubai Courts together.
        </p>

        <h3>Stage 2: Filing the Enforcement Application</h3>

        <p>
          Your lawyer files an enforcement application in Dubai Courts Execution Department. The application includes the DIFC judgment, the Arabic translation, proof that the DIFC judgment is final and enforceable, and details of the assets or party you are enforcing against.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dubai Courts reviews the Arabic translation to verify the DIFC judgment does not violate UAE public policy. This is a limited review. Dubai Courts do not re-examine the factual or legal merits of the DIFC case.
        </p>

        <h3>Stage 3: Enforcement Order and Execution</h3>

        <p>
          If Dubai Courts approves the enforcement application, they issue an enforcement order. This order allows the Dubai Courts Execution Department to take enforcement actions like seizing bank accounts, attaching property, or garnishing wages.
        </p>

        <p>
          The enforcement order is issued in Arabic. If the judgment debtor is an international party, you may need an <a href="/resources/difc-translation-guide/">English translation of the Dubai Courts enforcement order</a> for coordination with foreign counsel.
        </p>

        <h2>Common Legal Terminology Challenges</h2>

        <p>
          DIFC Courts use common law terminology. Dubai Courts use civil law terminology. These systems have different legal concepts, and direct translation is not always possible.
        </p>

        <h3>Common Law vs Civil Law Terminology</h3>

        <p>
          For example, DIFC judgments refer to "summary judgment" or "judgment in default." Dubai Courts do not have exact equivalents for these common law procedures. An experienced legal translator uses Arabic civil law terminology that conveys the same legal effect.
        </p>

        <p>
          DIFC judgments may include "injunctions" or "specific performance orders." Dubai Courts recognize similar remedies but use different Arabic terminology rooted in UAE civil law. Incorrect terminology can cause Dubai Courts to misunderstand the enforcement scope.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="/legal/contracts/">Contract translation</a> faces similar challenges. DIFC contracts use terms like "consideration," "estoppel," or "fiduciary duty" that require careful adaptation to Arabic civil law equivalents.
        </p>

        <h3>Financial and Technical Terms</h3>

        <p>
          DIFC cases often involve complex financial instruments, derivatives, or banking transactions. The Arabic translation must accurately convey these technical concepts. Mistranslating a financial term can change the judgment amount or enforcement target.
        </p>

        <p>
          Interest calculations in DIFC judgments need precise Arabic translation. UAE law distinguishes between different types of interest, and the Arabic terminology must align with Dubai Courts practice.
        </p>

        <h2>Timeline for Translation and Enforcement</h2>

        <p>
          Planning the enforcement timeline requires coordination between translation, document preparation, and Dubai Courts filing deadlines.
        </p>

        <h3>Translation Timeline</h3>

        <p>
          Standard DIFC judgment translation takes 3-5 business days. This assumes a 10-15 page judgment with typical commercial litigation content. Add 1-2 days if you are also translating supporting pleadings or exhibits.
        </p>

        <p>
          Complex judgments with over 30 pages or highly technical content take 7-10 days. Rush service (48-hour turnaround) is available for an additional fee if you have urgent enforcement needs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Review the Arabic translation with your enforcement lawyer before filing. This catches any terminology issues early. Minor corrections take 1-2 days.
        </p>

        <h3>Dubai Courts Enforcement Timeline</h3>

        <p>
          After filing your enforcement application, Dubai Courts typically issues a preliminary review decision within 2-3 weeks. If Dubai Courts requests additional information or clarification on the translation, add another 1-2 weeks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once Dubai Courts issues the enforcement order, execution actions can begin immediately. However, locating assets, serving notices, and completing enforcement can take several months depending on the judgment debtor's cooperation.
        </p>

        <p>
          For detailed timelines, see our <a href="/resources/turnaround-times/">translation turnaround times guide</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>ADGM Judgments and Dubai Courts Enforcement</h2>

        <p>
          ADGM Courts operate under the same common law framework as DIFC Courts. If you are enforcing an ADGM judgment in Dubai Courts, the translation requirements are identical.
        </p>

        <h3>ADGM-Dubai Courts Cooperation</h3>

        <p>
          Dubai Law No. 2 of 2025 applies to both DIFC and ADGM judgments. ADGM judgments are recognized and enforced in Dubai Courts without re-litigation, provided all documents are translated into Arabic by an MOJ-licensed translator.
        </p>

        <p>
          The document list for ADGM judgments mirrors DIFC requirements: the final judgment, pleadings, witness statements, and key exhibits. ADGM Courts also issue judgments in English, so MOJ translation is always required for Dubai Courts enforcement.
        </p>

        <p>
          For more on ADGM translation requirements, see our <a href="/resources/adgm-translation-requirements/">ADGM guide</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Sharjah Courts and Abu Dhabi Courts</h3>

        <p>
          The same MOJ translation is valid for enforcing DIFC or ADGM judgments in other UAE emirates. Sharjah Courts and Abu Dhabi Courts follow the same Arabic language requirement. You do not need separate translations for each emirate.
        </p>

        <h2>Translation Quality and Legal Accuracy</h2>

        <p>
          DIFC judgment translation requires both linguistic accuracy and legal expertise. A mistranslation can delay enforcement or cause Dubai Courts to misunderstand the judgment scope.
        </p>

        <h3>The MOJ Licensing Requirement</h3>

        <p>
          Dubai Courts only accept translations from MOJ-licensed translators. Our translator holds MOJ License #701, issued to Khaled Mohamed Abdulwahab Al-Adl. The MOJ license guarantees the translator meets UAE legal translation standards.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each translated page includes the MOJ stamp, the translator's signature, and the license number. Dubai Courts verify this information before accepting the translation.
        </p>

        <p>
          For more on licensing, see our <a href="/resources/moj-vs-certified/">MOJ vs Certified Translation guide</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Pre-Filing Review with Your Lawyer</h3>

        <p>
          We recommend reviewing the Arabic translation with your enforcement lawyer before filing in Dubai Courts. Your lawyer can confirm the translation accurately reflects the DIFC judgment and uses appropriate Arabic legal terminology.
        </p>

        <p>
          If corrections are needed, we revise and restamp the document at no additional cost. This pre-filing review prevents delays or clarification requests from Dubai Courts.
        </p>

        <h2>Cost and Pricing for DIFC Judgment Translation</h2>

        <p>
          Translation cost depends on the judgment length, complexity, and turnaround time. DIFC judgments are typically longer and more technical than standard civil documents.
        </p>

        <h3>Pricing Structure</h3>

        <p>
          MOJ legal translation starts at AED 150 per page for standard content. DIFC judgments with complex financial analysis or technical legal arguments may be priced at AED 200-250 per page due to the specialized terminology.
        </p>

        <p>
          The MOJ stamp fee is additional, typically AED 50-100 per document depending on page count. Rush service (48-hour turnaround) adds 50% to the base translation fee.
        </p>

        <p>
          For a detailed breakdown, see our <a href="/resources/pricing-guide/">translation pricing guide</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Document Volume and Package Pricing</h3>

        <p>
          If you are translating multiple documents for enforcement (judgment plus pleadings plus exhibits), we offer package pricing. Contact us via WhatsApp with your document list for a quote.
        </p>

        <p>
          Large document sets (over 100 pages) qualify for volume discounts. This is common in complex commercial litigation with extensive evidence files.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Get Started</h2>
