const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Do I need translated documents for DataFlow verification?",
    answer: "No. DataFlow performs Primary Source Verification directly with your issuing institutions. They do not require translated documents. Translation becomes necessary later — when you apply for DHA registration, employment through MOHRE, and UAE residency through GDRFA."
  },
  {
    question: "When exactly do I need Arabic translation in the DHA licensing process?",
    answer: "After passing DataFlow and Prometric. When you submit your DHA registration application on Sheryan, any document not in English or Arabic needs certified legal translation. DHA Manual Section 5.7 requires original copies with certified legal translation."
  },
  {
    question: "Which documents need translation for DHA registration?",
    answer: "Educational certificates, transcripts, experience letters, professional licenses, Good Standing Certificates, and surgical logbooks — if they are in a language other than English or Arabic. Documents in English or Arabic do not need translation."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between Sheryan and DHCC?",
    answer: "Sheryan (services.dha.gov.ae/sheryan) handles all DHA mainland Dubai licensing. DHCC (Dubai Healthcare City) is a separate free zone track that performs its own verification and does not use DataFlow. If you're working in DHCC, requirements differ. This guide covers the mainland DHA/Sheryan process."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the full DHA licensing process take?",
    answer: "From initial self-assessment to active license: typically 3-6 months. DataFlow PSV takes 3-6 weeks. Prometric scheduling adds 2-4 weeks. DHA review takes 5-10 working days. Employment, entry permit, and residency processing adds another 4-8 weeks."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need MOHESR equivalency for DHA licensing?",
    answer: "Not always. MOHESR equivalency (Certificate of Recognition) may be required if your degree is from a university not in DHA's recognized list, or for certain specialties. Your employer or DHA Sheryan application will indicate if equivalency is needed. See our <a href='/resources/mohesr-degree-translation-guide/'>MOHESR guide</a> for details."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the cost of DataFlow verification?",
    answer: "DataFlow PSV costs AED 935-1,235 depending on the profession and number of documents verified. This is separate from Prometric exam fees, DHA registration fees, and translation costs."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I start working before my DHA license is activated?",
    answer: "No. You cannot practice healthcare in Dubai without an activated DHA license. After DHA issues your registration certificate, your employer must activate your license on Sheryan. Only then can you legally practice."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need separate translations for DHA and GDRFA?",
    answer: "No. The same MOJ-certified translation works for both DHA registration and GDRFA residency applications. One translation serves all UAE government authorities. Send your documents via <a href='https://wa.me/971508620217'>WhatsApp</a> and we handle everything."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my Good Standing Certificate is not in English?",
    answer: "Good Standing Certificates from non-English-speaking countries need MOJ-certified Arabic translation for DHA registration. Countries like China, Japan, South Korea, and Middle Eastern countries commonly issue these in their local language."

        Every guide about DHA licensing covers DataFlow and Prometric. Nobody covers what comes after — the document preparation for DHA registration, MOHRE employment, and UAE residency. This is where translation and attestation become critical. DataFlow does not require translated documents. DHA registration does.

  <!-- Documents That Need Translation -->
  <section class="section bg-light">
    <div class="container container--narrow">
      <h2>Which Documents Need Translation?</h2>
      <p>This is the key question. The answer depends on what language your documents are in and at which stage you are.</p>

      <h3>For DHA Registration (Phase 2)</h3>
      <p>Per DHA Manual Version 1.1 (November 2024), Section 5.7, these documents need certified legal translation if not in English or Arabic:</p>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li><strong><a href="/personal/academic/degree/">Educational certificates</a></strong> — degree, diploma, specialization certificates</li>
        <li><strong>Academic transcripts</strong> — full transcript of marks/grades</li>
        <li><strong>Experience letters</strong> — from all previous healthcare employers</li>
        <li><strong>Professional licenses</strong> — from your home country's health authority</li>
        <li><strong>Good Standing Certificates</strong> — from every country where you practiced</li>
        <li><strong>Surgical logbooks</strong> — for surgical specialties</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>For Employment and Residency (Phase 3)</h3>
      <p>Additional documents that need translation at the employment stage:</p>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li><strong>Attested degree</strong> — for <a href="/resources/mohre-work-permit-guide/">MOHRE work permit</a> application</li>
        <li><strong>Employment contract</strong> — MOHRE standard dual-language contract</li>
        <li><strong><a href="/personal/vital-records/marriage/">Marriage certificate</a></strong> — if sponsoring family</li>
        <li><strong><a href="/personal/vital-records/birth/">Birth certificates</a></strong> — for dependent children</li>
        <li><strong><a href="/personal/immigration/pcc/">Police clearance certificate</a></strong> — if required for your nationality</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout-block callout-block--info">
        <h4>Documents You Do NOT Need to Translate</h4>
        <p>Documents already in English or Arabic do not need translation. This includes UK, US, Australian, Canadian, and many GCC-issued documents. DataFlow PSV report itself does not need translation. Prometric exam results are in English. Check our <a href="/resources/translation-type-decision-guide/">translation type guide</a> to determine what needs translating.</p>
