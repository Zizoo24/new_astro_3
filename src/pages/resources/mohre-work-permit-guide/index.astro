  {
    question: "What documents do I need for a UAE work permit?",
    answer: "You need a valid passport (minimum 6 months validity), degree certificate (attested), passport photographs, employment offer letter, and Emirates ID application. Your degree and any experience letters from non-English/Arabic countries must be translated. Your employer handles the work permit application through Tasheel."
  },
  {
    question: "Does my degree certificate need Arabic translation for MOHRE?",
    answer: "If your degree is in a language other than Arabic or English, yes. MOHRE's Eye AI system reads Arabic and English. Degrees in Hindi, Urdu, Chinese, Filipino, or any other language require MOJ-certified Arabic translation. <a href='https://wa.me/971508620217'>Send your degree via WhatsApp</a> and we confirm what's needed."
  },
  {
    question: "What is MOHRE's Eye AI system?",
    answer: "Eye is an AI-powered document verification system MOHRE launched in October 2025. It uses OCR and computer vision to check document authenticity, completeness, and compliance before any human reviewer sees your application. Errors that a clerk might overlook are now caught automatically."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if MOHRE flags my application as incomplete?",
    answer: "Your application enters the Nawakas process — MOHRE's system for handling missing or deficient documents. You receive a specific notification about what's missing and must submit corrections through Tasheel. This adds days to weeks to your timeline depending on what needs fixing."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I get my degree attested before or after translation?",
    answer: "Attestation first, translation second. Your degree must go through the full attestation chain (home country authentication, then UAE MOFA) before translation. The Arabic translation must include all attestation stamps and stickers. Translating before attesting means paying for translation twice."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need MOHESR equivalency for my degree?",
    answer: "Not always. MOHESR equivalency (now called Certificate of Recognition) is required when your degree is from a university not recognized by MOHESR, or when your profession requires specific degree verification. Check with your employer — they know whether your role requires it. Our <a href='/resources/mohesr-degree-translation-guide/'>MOHESR guide</a> covers this in detail."
  },
  {
    question: "What languages does the MOHRE employment contract come in?",
    answer: "MOHRE standard employment contracts are dual-language: Arabic and English. Since January 2016, a third language can be added — Bengali, Chinese, Dari, Hindi, Malayalam, Nepalese, Sinhalese, Tamil, or Urdu. The Arabic version is legally binding in case of disputes."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I start working before my work permit is approved?",
    answer: "No. Working before your work permit is issued is illegal and can result in fines for both you and your employer. The typical timeline from application to work permit issuance is 5-10 working days if all documents are correct. Some free zones have different processes."
  },
  {
    question: "My employer says documents are their responsibility. What should I prepare?",
    answer: "Your employer handles the MOHRE application through Tasheel, but you provide the documents. Prepare your attested degree, passport copies, photographs, and any translated documents in advance. Delays happen because employees wait for their employer to ask rather than preparing proactively."
  },
  {
    question: "Do experience letters need translation for MOHRE?",
    answer: "If your experience letters are in a language other than Arabic or English, they need MOJ-certified translation. Even English experience letters may need translation if they are from companies that issue bilingual letters where the primary language is not Arabic or English."

      <p>These are the documents you need to prepare. Your employer or their PRO will tell you what to bring, but having everything ready in advance prevents delays.</p>

      <h3>Documents You Provide</h3>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li><strong>Passport</strong> — minimum 6 months validity remaining. MOHRE's system blocks applications where the passport expires within 6 months.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="/personal/academic/degree/">Degree certificate</a></strong> — attested through the full chain, then translated to Arabic if not in English or Arabic</li>
        <li><strong>Experience letters</strong> — from previous employers, translated if not in English or Arabic</li>
        <li><strong>Passport photographs</strong> — white background, recent</li>
        <li><strong>Any professional licenses</strong> — for regulated professions (healthcare, engineering, teaching)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Documents Your Employer Handles</h3>
      <ul class="checklist checklist--employer">
        <li><strong>Employment offer letter</strong> — must match the MOHRE standard contract format</li>
        <li><strong>MOHRE standard employment contract</strong> — dual-language Arabic + English</li>
        <li><strong>Company trade license</strong> — proving the business is authorized to hire</li>
        <li><strong>Establishment card</strong> — company's MOHRE registration</li>
        <li><strong>Quota approval</strong> — some company types have hiring limits</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout-block callout-block--info">
        <h4>Documents You Do NOT Need to Translate</h4>
        <p>Passports, Emirates ID, and documents already in Arabic or English do not need translation. Your employer's trade license and establishment card are their responsibility. Only translate documents from your home country that are in other languages. Check our <a href="/resources/translation-type-decision-guide/">translation type guide</a> if unsure.</p>

            <p>Before anything else, your <a href="/personal/academic/degree/">degree certificate</a> must be attested. The chain depends on your home country.</p>

            <h3>Translate Non-English/Arabic Documents</h3>
            <p>After attestation, have your documents translated by an <a href="/legal-translation-dubai/">MOJ-certified translator</a>. Documents that typically need translation:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="/personal/academic/degree/">Degree certificates</a> in Hindi, Urdu, Chinese, Filipino, Bengali, or other languages</li>

            <p>Common delays at this stage:</p>
            <ul>

            <h3>MOHRE Eye AI Reviews Your Application</h3>
            <p>Since October 2025, MOHRE uses the "Eye" AI system for initial document review. This system uses Regula OCR and Azure AI Vision to verify:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Document authenticity (detecting alterations or forgeries)</li>
              <li>Completeness (all required documents present)</li>
              <li>Compliance (attestation chain intact, translations certified)</li>
              <li>Hard blocks: passport validity under 6 months, residency under 1 month</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The AI catches errors that human clerks sometimes missed. Blurry scans, missing attestation stamps, and unsigned translations are all flagged automatically.</p>

            <p>If everything passes review, the work permit is issued within 5-10 working days.</p>
            <p>If something is missing or incorrect, your application enters <strong>Nawakas</strong> — MOHRE's process for handling deficient applications. The system identifies what is missing and provides a specific notification. Your employer must submit corrections through Tasheel.</p>
            <p>Nawakas is more informative than GDRFA rejections. MOHRE usually tells you what is wrong. But each correction cycle adds days to weeks.</p>

  <!-- Common Rejection Reasons -->
  <section class="section bg-light">
    <div class="container container--narrow">
      <h2>Most Common MOHRE Rejection Reasons</h2>
      <p>Based on MOHRE's published guidance and what we see from clients who need urgent retranslation after rejection.</p>

      <ol class="rejection-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Missing documents</strong>
          <p>The single most frequent cause. Usually a degree that was never submitted, or an experience letter that was forgotten. Use the checklist above.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Expired passport or residency</strong>
          <p>MOHRE's Eye system blocks these automatically. No human even reviews the application.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Missing or unclear academic certificates</strong>
          <p>Degrees that are blurry, partially cropped, or in a language the system cannot process. Always provide a clear scan plus the Arabic translation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Job offer contradicts labor law</strong>
          <p>Employer issue, not yours. But it stalls the permit. The job title and description must match your qualifications and the company's licensed activities.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Occupation-to-business mismatch</strong>
          <p>Your job title must align with your employer's trade license activities. A restaurant cannot hire an "engineer" through MOHRE.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Company violations or quota exceeded</strong>
          <p>If your employer has unresolved labor violations or has exceeded their hiring quota, no new permits are issued. This is outside your control.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

  <!-- Employment Contract Language -->
  <section class="section bg-white">
    <div class="container container--narrow">
      <h2>Understanding the MOHRE Employment Contract</h2>
      <p>MOHRE mandates a standard employment contract format. Understanding its language requirements protects you.</p>

      <h3>Language Requirements</h3>
      <p>Every MOHRE standard employment contract is dual-language: <strong>Arabic and English</strong>. Since January 2016, a third language can be added for the worker's benefit:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bengali, Chinese, Dari, Hindi, Malayalam</li>
        <li>Nepalese, Sinhalese, Tamil, Urdu</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The job offer letter must also be in Arabic, English, and a language the worker understands.</p>

      <div class="callout-block callout-block--warning">
        <h4>The Arabic Version Controls</h4>
        <p>In any dispute, the Arabic text of the employment contract is the legally binding version. If the English text contradicts the Arabic, the Arabic prevails. Make sure you understand both versions before signing. If your contract includes a <a href="/legal/contracts/lease/">lease agreement</a> or other supplementary documents, these may also require Arabic translation.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>What You Should Check</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Job title</strong> — matches your qualifications and the actual role</li>
        <li><strong>Salary</strong> — matches the offer letter exactly</li>
        <li><strong>Probation period</strong> — maximum 6 months under UAE labor law</li>
        <li><strong>Notice period</strong> — standard is 30 days; confirm in both language versions</li>
        <li><strong>Benefits</strong> — housing, transport, medical insurance terms</li>
      </ul>
