  {
    question: "Are distance education degrees valid for UAE work permits?",
    answer: "Yes, but with conditions. MOHRE accepts distance education degrees from accredited universities recognized by the issuing country's education ministry. The degree must be <a href='/resources/attestation-guide/'>attested through the standard chain</a> (apostille/authentication → UAE Embassy → MOFA), then <a href='/personal/academic/degree/'>translated by an MOJ-certified translator</a>. Online degrees from unaccredited institutions or diploma mills are rejected."
  },
  {
    question: "Does MOHRE accept online degrees?",
    answer: "MOHRE accepts online degrees if: (1) the university is accredited in its home country, (2) the degree is recognized by the home country's education ministry, and (3) proper <a href='/services/attestation/'>attestation is completed</a>. The degree certificate itself does not need to state whether it was earned online or in-person—what matters is the institution's accreditation status."
  },
  {
    question: "Are Open University degrees accepted in UAE?",
    answer: "UK Open University degrees are accepted by MOHRE because the Open University is a fully accredited UK institution. For <a href='/services/attestation/uk/'>UK degree attestation</a>, you need an FCDO apostille, UAE Embassy attestation, and MOFA. Similarly, IGNOU (India) with <a href='/services/attestation/india/'>MEA apostille</a> and other government-recognized open universities are accepted."
  },
  {
    question: "Will my distance learning degree need MOHESR equivalency?",
    answer: "For most private sector employment, no—only <a href='/personal/academic/degree/'>MOJ-certified translation</a> is required. <a href='/resources/mohesr-equivalency/'>MOHESR equivalency</a> is needed for: government jobs, <a href='/services/golden-visa-translation/'>Golden Visa</a> (skilled category), teaching positions, and some professional licensing like <a href='/specialized/medical/dha-dataflow/'>DHA healthcare licensing</a>."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get a Golden Visa with a distance education degree?",
    answer: "Potentially yes. <a href='/services/golden-visa-translation/'>Golden Visa skilled employee category</a> requires a bachelor's degree or higher from an accredited institution, plus <a href='/resources/mohesr-equivalency/'>MOHESR equivalency</a>. Distance education degrees that receive MOHESR equivalency are accepted. See our <a href='/resources/golden-visa-checklist/'>Golden Visa document checklist</a> for complete requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I prove my online degree is accredited?",
    answer: "The <a href='/resources/attestation-guide/'>attestation chain</a> itself serves as proof of accreditation. When your home country's education ministry (or MEA/MOFA) authenticates the degree, they verify the issuing institution. For <a href='/services/attestation/india/'>Indian degrees</a>, MEA apostille confirms UGC recognition. For <a href='/services/attestation/us/'>US degrees</a>, state authentication confirms regional accreditation."
  },
  {
    question: "Are correspondence degrees the same as distance education?",
    answer: "Yes, for UAE purposes 'correspondence,' 'distance learning,' and 'online' degrees are treated the same way. What matters is whether the issuing institution is accredited. Older correspondence degrees from established universities (like those from Indian universities' distance education programs) are accepted if properly <a href='/services/attestation/india/'>attested through MEA</a>."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my degree says 'Distance Education' on it?",
    answer: "This does not affect acceptance for most purposes. MOHRE does not distinguish between distance and regular degrees on the certificate itself. Our <a href='/personal/academic/degree/'>degree translation service</a> translates exactly what appears on your certificate. Some employers may have their own policies, but legally, an attested degree from an accredited institution is valid."

        </div>
        <p><strong>Distance education degrees are accepted by MOHRE</strong> if the issuing institution is accredited by the home country's education ministry. The degree must complete the standard attestation chain before translation. Mode of study (online, distance, correspondence) does not affect validity.</p>

      <h2>What MOHRE Actually Requires</h2>

      <p>The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MOHRE) does not distinguish between degrees earned through classroom attendance or distance learning. Their requirements are:</p>

        <div class="requirement-card">
          <div class="requirement-icon"><i class="fas fa-university"></i></div>
          <h3>Accredited Institution</h3>
          <p>The university must be officially recognized by the education ministry in the country where it operates. This is verified through the attestation process.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="requirement-card">
          <div class="requirement-icon"><i class="fas fa-stamp"></i></div>
          <h3>Complete Attestation</h3>
          <p>The degree must complete the full authentication chain: home country apostille/attestation → UAE Embassy → MOFA UAE. No shortcuts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="requirement-card">
          <div class="requirement-icon"><i class="fas fa-language"></i></div>
          <h3>MOJ-Certified Translation</h3>
          <p>After attestation, the degree needs <a href="/personal/academic/degree/">MOJ-certified translation</a> for MOHRE submission.</p>

      <div class="info-callout">
        <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i>
        <div>
          <strong>The attestation process itself verifies accreditation.</strong> When your home country's education ministry grants authentication, they confirm the institution is recognized. If your degree gets attested, it has passed the accreditation check.
