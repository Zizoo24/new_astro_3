      <h2>Understanding Wills in the UAE</h2>
      <div class="content-prose">
        <p>The UAE has specific rules regarding wills, particularly for non-Muslims. Without a registered will, UAE Sharia law may govern estate distribution—which follows different principles than many expats expect. Proper will registration protects your wishes and simplifies administration for your heirs.</p>
        
        <h3>DIFC Wills Registry</h3>
        <p>The DIFC Wills and Probate Registry offers non-Muslims a way to register wills that will be enforced according to the will's terms rather than Sharia law. This applies to assets in Dubai and can reference guardianship of minor children. Registration requires specific formats and, in some cases, Arabic translation.</p>
        
        <h3>Abu Dhabi Wills Registry</h3>
        <p>ADJD (Abu Dhabi Judicial Department) operates its own wills registry with similar purposes. Abu Dhabi residents or those with Abu Dhabi assets may use this registry to ensure their wishes are respected.</p>
        
        <h3>Foreign Wills</h3>
        <p>Many expats have wills registered in their home countries. These wills may need translation for use in UAE probate proceedings, particularly when UAE-located assets are involved. Translation ensures UAE authorities understand the will's provisions.</p>

      <h2>When Will Translation is Required</h2>
      <div class="content-prose">
        <h3>Probate Proceedings</h3>
        <p>When someone passes away with UAE assets, probate proceedings may require will translation. Courts need to understand the will's provisions to administer the estate correctly. Certified translation ensures the will is properly considered in these proceedings.</p>
        
        <h3>Asset Transfer</h3>
        <p>Banks, property registrars, and company registries may require translated wills when transferring assets to beneficiaries. The translation confirms the beneficiary's entitlement under the will's terms.</p>
        
        <h3>Registry Requirements</h3>
        <p>Some will registries require Arabic translations alongside English wills. Check with your chosen registry about specific requirements. We can provide certified translations meeting registry standards.</p>
        
        <h3>Cross-Border Estates</h3>
        <p>Estates involving assets in multiple countries may require wills translated into various languages. We translate between English and Arabic, and can coordinate translation into other languages when needed.</p>

      <h2>Handling Sensitive Documents</h2>
      <div class="content-prose">
        <p>Wills are deeply personal documents. They may reveal family circumstances, financial positions, and personal wishes that the testator wanted kept private. We handle wills with appropriate sensitivity and confidentiality.</p>
        
        <h3>Confidentiality Protocols</h3>
        <p>Will translations are handled with enhanced confidentiality. Documents are not shared beyond essential team members, and we can implement additional security measures upon request.</p>
        
        <h3>Accuracy Standards</h3>
        <p>Wills use precise legal language where every word matters. "Per stirpes" versus "per capita" distribution, "issue" versus "children," specific bequests versus residuary estate—these distinctions significantly affect how the estate is distributed. Our legal translators understand these concepts and translate them correctly.</p>
        
        <h3>Coordination with Lawyers</h3>
        <p>Many clients arrange will translation through their lawyers or estate planners. We work directly with legal professionals, ensuring translations meet their standards and use appropriate terminology for the UAE legal system.</p>
