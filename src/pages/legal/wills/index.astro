const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'Why would I need my will translated in Dubai?',
    answer: 'Common scenarios include: registering a foreign will with DIFC Wills Service Centre, probate proceedings when a foreign national dies with UAE assets, property transfer at Dubai Land Department, bank account release requiring translated probate documentation, and cross-border estate coordination.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between DIFC Wills and Dubai Courts Wills?',
    answer: 'DIFC Wills are registered with the DIFC Wills Service Centre and follow common law principles, allowing non-Muslims to distribute assets according to their wishes. Dubai Courts Wills fall under UAE civil law and Sharia principles. The translation requirements differ significantly: DIFC accepts English-language wills, while Dubai Courts require Arabic translations certified by MOJ-licensed translators. We format your translation for the correct jurisdiction based on your specific situation.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to translate my foreign will for use in Dubai?',
    answer: 'Yes. Any will executed outside the UAE must be translated into Arabic by an MOJ-certified translator before it can be presented to Dubai Courts. For DIFC registration, English wills from common law jurisdictions may be accepted without translation, but supporting documents such as death certificates and probate grants typically require certified translation regardless of jurisdiction.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does will translation take?',
    answer: 'Standard will translations of 5-15 pages are completed within 24-48 hours. Express same-day service is available for urgent probate matters where court deadlines are imminent. Complex wills with multiple schedules, trust provisions, or codicils may require 3-5 business days. We provide an exact timeline after reviewing your specific document.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is my will kept confidential?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. We understand wills contain sensitive family and financial information. All documents are handled under strict confidentiality protocols by senior translators only. Files are transmitted via encrypted channels, stored on secure servers, and permanently deleted from our systems upon request after delivery. We can sign NDAs for particularly sensitive estates.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What documents do I need alongside the will translation?',
    answer: 'For probate proceedings, you typically need the original will or certified copy, death certificate of the testator, grant of probate or letters of administration from the home jurisdiction, and identification documents of beneficiaries. All foreign documents require certified translation and may need attestation depending on court requirements. We can advise on the complete document package for your situation.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate wills from any language?',
    answer: 'Yes. We translate wills from 43+ languages into Arabic and English. Common language pairs include Arabic-English, French-Arabic, German-Arabic, Russian-Arabic, Hindi-Arabic, and Urdu-Arabic. Each translator assigned to estate documents has legal specialization and experience with testamentary terminology.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Which jurisdiction applies to my situation?',
    answer: 'Jurisdiction depends on your religion, nationality, residency status, and asset types. Non-Muslims with a registered DIFC Will have their UAE assets distributed according to their wishes under common law. Without a DIFC Will, non-Muslim estates may default to Sharia distribution. We advise on the correct translation format based on jurisdiction, though we recommend consulting with a UAE estate lawyer for complex situations.'

      <h2>Understanding Will Translation in Dubai</h2>
      
      <p>Dubai operates under a dual legal system for inheritance matters. Understanding which jurisdiction applies to your situation determines the translation requirements, court procedures, and ultimate distribution of assets. We help you navigate this complexity with translations formatted correctly from the start.</p>

      <h3>The DIFC Wills Jurisdiction</h3>
      
      <p>The Dubai International Financial Centre established its Wills Service Centre in 2015, offering non-Muslim residents the ability to register wills that follow common law principles rather than Sharia inheritance rules. This is particularly important for expatriates who wish to distribute assets according to their own wishes rather than the forced heirship provisions of UAE civil law.</p>
      
      <p>DIFC Wills can cover real estate located anywhere in Dubai, bank accounts, investments, business interests, personal property, and guardianship provisions for minor children. The registration process requires in-person attendance at the DIFC Wills Service Centre, typically with supporting documents including identification and translations of existing foreign wills where relevant.</p>
      
      <p>While DIFC operates primarily in English, supporting documents from non-English jurisdictions require certified translation. We provide translations of foreign wills, death certificates, and probate grants formatted for DIFC submission standards.</p>

      <h3>Dubai Courts and UAE Civil Law</h3>
      
      <p>Matters falling outside DIFC jurisdiction or where no DIFC Will was registered are handled by Dubai Courts under UAE Federal Law. For non-Muslims, this can create complexity as the default distribution follows Sharia principles unless a registered will directs otherwise.</p>
      
      <p>All documents submitted to Dubai Courts must be in Arabic. Foreign wills, death certificates, and probate grants require MOJ-certified translation before the court will accept them. The translation must accurately convey legal terminology while using appropriate Arabic legal equivalents recognized by UAE courts.</p>
      
      <p>Our translators specialize in estate terminology across multiple legal systems. We understand the differences between UK executors and UAE court-appointed administrators, between US probate procedures and UAE inheritance processes. This comparative knowledge ensures your translation is not just linguistically accurate but legally functional.</p>

      <h3>The Sensitivity of Estate Documents</h3>
      
      <p>We recognize that wills contain deeply personal information about family relationships, asset details, and final wishes. Many clients are processing these documents during an already difficult time following the loss of a family member.</p>
      
      <p>Our approach reflects this reality. We handle estate documents with appropriate gravity and discretion. Senior translators process these files directly rather than distributing to junior staff or external contractors. Confidentiality is absolute.</p>
