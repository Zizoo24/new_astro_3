    question: 'Why would I need my will translated in Dubai?',
    answer: 'Common reasons: registering a foreign will with DIFC, probate when a foreign national dies with UAE assets, property transfer at DLD, bank account release, or cross-border estate coordination.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between DIFC Wills and Dubai Courts Wills?',
    answer: 'DIFC Wills follow common law—non-Muslims can distribute assets as they wish. Dubai Courts Wills follow UAE civil law and Sharia. DIFC accepts English wills. Dubai Courts require Arabic translations with MOJ certification. We format for the correct jurisdiction.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to translate my foreign will for use in Dubai?',
    answer: 'For Dubai Courts, yes—foreign wills need Arabic MOJ-certified translation. For DIFC, English wills from common law countries may work without translation. But supporting documents (death certificates, probate grants) still need certified translation.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does will translation take?',
    answer: 'Standard wills (5-15 pages): 24-48 hours. Express same-day for urgent probate. Complex wills with trusts or multiple schedules: 3-5 business days. We confirm exact timeline after reviewing your document.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is my will kept confidential?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. Senior translators only handle estate documents. Files use encrypted channels and secure servers. We delete files upon request after delivery. NDAs available for sensitive estates.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What documents do I need alongside the will translation?',
    answer: 'For probate: original will or certified copy, death certificate, grant of probate or letters of administration, and beneficiary IDs. Foreign documents need translation and may need attestation. We advise on your complete package.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate wills from any language?',
    answer: 'Yes. We translate from 43+ languages. Common pairs: Arabic-English, French-Arabic, German-Arabic, Russian-Arabic, Hindi-Arabic, Urdu-Arabic. All estate translators have legal specialization.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Which jurisdiction applies to my situation?',
    answer: 'It depends on religion, nationality, residency, and asset types. Non-Muslims with DIFC Wills follow common law. Without one, estates may default to Sharia. We advise on translation format. For complex cases, consult a UAE estate lawyer.'

<h3>Dubai's Dual Inheritance System</h3>
<p><strong>DIFC Wills Service Centre</strong> (established 2015) allows non-Muslims to register wills following common law principles. DIFC Wills cover Dubai real estate, bank accounts, investments, business interests, and guardianship provisions. Supporting documents from non-English jurisdictions require certified translation.</p>
<p><strong>Dubai Courts</strong> handle inheritance under UAE Federal Law for matters outside DIFC jurisdiction. All submissions must be in Arabic. Foreign wills, <a href="/personal/vital-records/death/">death certificates</a>, and probate grants require MOJ-certified translation.</p>

<h3>Common Scenarios</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Probate of foreign nationals</strong> — With UAE assets</li>
<li><strong>Property transfer at DLD</strong> — Inheritance transfers</li>
<li><strong>Bank account release</strong> — For beneficiaries</li>
<li><strong>DIFC registration</strong> — Non-English wills needing translation</li>
</ul>

<h3>What Must Be Captured</h3>
<p>Testator identification, beneficiary details, asset descriptions, distribution provisions, executor appointments, guardianship provisions, and attestation marks. Ambiguity causes disputes, delays, or unintended consequences.</p>

<h3>Confidentiality</h3>
<p>Wills contain deeply personal information about family relationships and final wishes. Senior translators handle estate documents directly with appropriate discretion. Confidentiality is absolute.</p>

<h3>Turnaround</h3>
<p>Standard: <strong>24-48 hours</strong>. Express same-day service available for urgent probate matters. Cross-border estates (India, Pakistan, UK, USA, Europe) handled regularly.</p>`}

      <h2>Understanding Will Translation</h2>
      
      <p>Dubai operates under a dual legal system for inheritance matters. Understanding which jurisdiction applies to your situation determines the translation requirements, court procedures, and ultimate distribution of assets. We help you navigate this complexity with translations formatted correctly from the start.</p>

      <h3>The DIFC Wills Jurisdiction</h3>
      
      <p>The Dubai International Financial Centre established its Wills Service Centre in 2015, offering non-Muslim residents the ability to register wills that follow common law principles rather than Sharia inheritance rules. This is particularly important for expatriates who wish to distribute assets according to their own wishes rather than the forced heirship provisions of UAE civil law.</p>
      
      <p>DIFC Wills can cover real estate located anywhere in Dubai, bank accounts, investments, business interests, personal property, and guardianship provisions for minor children. The registration process requires in-person attendance at the DIFC Wills Service Centre, typically with supporting documents including identification and translations of existing foreign wills where relevant.</p>
      
      <p>While DIFC operates primarily in English, supporting documents from non-English jurisdictions require certified translation. We provide translations of foreign wills, death certificates, and probate grants formatted for DIFC submission standards.</p>

      <h3>Dubai Courts and UAE Civil Law</h3>
      
      <p>Matters falling outside DIFC jurisdiction or where no DIFC Will was registered are handled by Dubai Courts under UAE Federal Law. For non-Muslims, this can create complexity as the default distribution follows Sharia principles unless a registered will directs otherwise.</p>
      
      <p>All documents submitted to Dubai Courts must be in Arabic. Foreign wills, death certificates, and probate grants require MOJ-certified translation before the court will accept them. The translation must accurately convey legal terminology while using appropriate Arabic legal equivalents recognized by UAE courts.</p>
      
      <p>Our translators specialize in estate terminology across multiple legal systems. We understand the differences between UK executors and UAE court-appointed administrators, between US probate procedures and UAE inheritance processes. This comparative knowledge ensures your translation is not just linguistically accurate but legally functional.</p>

      <h3>The Sensitivity of Estate Documents</h3>

      <p>We recognize that wills contain deeply personal information about family relationships, asset details, and final wishes. Many clients are processing these documents during an already difficult time following the loss of a family member.</p>

      <p>Our approach reflects this reality. We handle estate documents with appropriate gravity and discretion. Senior translators process these files directly rather than distributing to junior staff or external contractors. Confidentiality is absolute.</p>

      <h3>Common Will Translation Scenarios in Dubai</h3>

      <p><strong>Probate of Foreign Nationals:</strong> When an expatriate passes away in Dubai with UAE assets, or when a foreign national living abroad dies leaving Dubai property, their will needs translation for recognition. The Dubai Courts or DIFC Wills Registry will examine the translated will alongside <a href="/personal/vital-records/death/">death certificate</a> and probate documents from the home jurisdiction.</p>

      <p><strong>Property Transfer at DLD:</strong> The Dubai Land Department requires translated documentation before transferring property from a deceased owner to beneficiaries. This includes the will, death certificate, grant of probate, and proof of beneficiary identity. Without proper translation, property remains frozen regardless of what the original will states.</p>

      <p><strong>Bank Account Release:</strong> UAE banks freeze accounts when notified of an account holder's death. Releasing funds to beneficiaries requires translated probate documentation proving legal authority over the estate. Each bank has specific requirements, but all need Arabic translations certified by MOJ.</p>

      <p><strong>DIFC Will Registration:</strong> While DIFC operates in English, some clients have existing wills from non-English jurisdictions. Translating these documents helps DIFC staff understand the testator's existing wishes when drafting a new DIFC Will that will govern UAE assets.</p>

      <h3>What Will Translation Must Capture</h3>

      <p>Estate documents contain specific elements that require careful handling:</p>

      <ul class="content-list">
        <li><strong>Testator identification:</strong> Full name, nationality, passport details matching other official records</li>
        <li><strong>Beneficiary details:</strong> Names, relationships, identification where specified</li>
        <li><strong>Asset descriptions:</strong> Property details, account information, business interests</li>
        <li><strong>Distribution provisions:</strong> Exactly who receives what, in what proportions, under what conditions</li>
        <li><strong>Executor/administrator:</strong> Who has authority to manage the estate</li>
        <li><strong>Guardianship provisions:</strong> Arrangements for minor children if applicable</li>
        <li><strong>Attestation and witnessing:</strong> Signatures, dates, notarization marks</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Ambiguity in any of these elements can cause disputes, delays, or unintended consequences. We translate with the precision these stakes require.</p>

      <h3>Cross-Border Estate Complexities</h3>

      <p>Expatriates often have assets in multiple countries, each with different inheritance laws. A UK citizen living in Dubai might have a UK will covering UK assets and a DIFC Will covering Dubai property. When they pass away, both wills may need translation—the UK will for DIFC reference, the DIFC will for UK probate records.</p>

      <p>We regularly handle estates involving assets in India, Pakistan, UK, USA, and Europe alongside UAE holdings. This cross-border experience means we understand terminology across multiple legal systems and can ensure translations work effectively in each jurisdiction.</p>

      <h3>Timeline Considerations</h3>

      <p>Standard will translation completes within 24-48 hours for typical documents of 5-15 pages. Complex wills with trusts, multiple schedules, or extensive asset lists may require 3-5 business days for thorough translation and review.</p>

      <p>Urgent probate situations—where court dates loom or bank releases are pending—receive priority handling. Express same-day service is available when circumstances demand it. However, we never sacrifice accuracy for speed on estate documents.</p>

      <div class="info-callout">
        <h4><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Complete Estate Documentation</h4>
        <p>Estate settlement typically requires multiple documents beyond the will: <a href="/personal/vital-records/death/">death certificates</a>, grants of probate, letters of administration, and property deeds. We offer estate package pricing for families dealing with complete documentation needs.</p>
