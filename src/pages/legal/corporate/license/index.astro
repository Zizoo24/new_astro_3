const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'Why is trade license translation so commonly needed?',
    answer: 'Trade licenses are required for nearly every business interaction in the UAE—bank account opening, visa processing, contract signing, vendor registration, and government submissions. If the original is in Arabic, English translation may be needed. If from a free zone in English, Arabic translation is needed for mainland interactions.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What license types do you translate?',
    answer: 'We translate all UAE license types: DED mainland licenses, DMCC licenses, JAFZA licenses, DIFC licenses, professional licenses, industrial licenses, and licenses from all other free zones. We also translate foreign company registration certificates for UAE use.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How important is business activity translation?',
    answer: 'Critical. Banks and government entities use business activities to determine what your company can do. Mistranslated activities could limit your banking facilities or cause compliance issues. We use standardized activity descriptions that banks and regulators recognize.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How fast can you translate a trade license?',
    answer: 'Standard trade licenses are completed within 4-6 hours. Simple single-page licenses can often be done faster. Licenses with extensive activity lists or multiple pages may take longer. Rush service available for urgent bank meetings.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you translate license amendments?',
    answer: 'Yes. License amendments showing activity additions, shareholder changes, or manager updates need translation to update your records with banks and government entities. We ensure consistency with your original license translation.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What about foreign company registrations?',
    answer: 'We translate foreign company registration certificates (UK Companies House, US state registrations, etc.) into Arabic for UAE use. These are often needed for branch registration, representative office setup, or contract signing.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What causes banks to reject trade license translations?',
    answer: 'Banks reject translations for three main reasons: non-standard activity terminology that differs from DED-recognized descriptions, company name inconsistencies with other corporate documents like MOA translations, and missing details such as shareholder percentages or validity dates. We prevent these issues by using DED-standardized terminology and cross-referencing your complete corporate document set.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need both Arabic and English translations?',
    answer: 'It depends on your use case. Free zone licenses in English need Arabic translation for mainland bank accounts and government submissions. DED mainland licenses that are bilingual may need certified English versions for international banking relationships or foreign partner agreements. We advise based on your specific requirement to avoid unnecessary translation costs.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle licenses with many business activities?',
    answer: 'Licenses with extensive activity lists (15+ activities) require careful attention to ensure each activity uses the correct standardized terminology. These take longer than simple licenses—typically 6-8 hours instead of 4-6. We quote based on complexity after reviewing your license. Each activity is individually verified against DED terminology databases.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between commercial and professional licenses?',
    answer: 'Commercial licenses allow trading, retail, and general commercial activities. Professional licenses are for service-based businesses like consultants, engineers, and healthcare practitioners. The translation approach differs—professional license activities must align with MOHRE visa categories for employee sponsorship, while commercial licenses focus on trading permissions that banks evaluate for facility approvals.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate an expired trade license?',
    answer: 'Yes, though the translation will reflect the expired status. Banks and government entities typically require current licenses, so we recommend renewing before translation unless you specifically need the expired version for historical records or legal proceedings. We note validity dates clearly so recipients understand the license status.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What additional documents should accompany license translation?',
    answer: 'For bank account opening, you typically need license translation alongside MOA translation, passport copies, and sometimes board resolutions. For visa processing, the license translation accompanies employment contract and employee documents. We can advise on the complete document package for your specific purpose and translate everything together for consistency.'

<h3>Why License Translation Rejections Happen</h3>
<p>Banks reject license translations when business activities use non-standard Arabic terminology. Your licensed activities determine what your company can legally do, what banking facilities you qualify for, and what contracts you can execute. Creative translations that don't match DED-recognized activity descriptions cause banks to question whether the translation accurately reflects your authorized operations. MOHRE visa applications fail when license details don't match other corporate documents. Government procurement portals reject vendor registrations with inconsistent company name renderings across documents. Article 9 of the Commercial Companies Law requires that company activities align with licensed scope—translation ambiguity creates compliance risk that banks and authorities avoid by requesting rework.</p>

<h3>License Types and Authority Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>DED mainland licenses</strong> (commercial, professional, industrial) are typically bilingual Arabic-English, but banks often require certified English translation for international partners and correspondent banking relationships. <strong>DMCC</strong>, <strong>JAFZA</strong>, and other free zone licenses are English-only, requiring Arabic translation for mainland bank accounts and government submissions. <strong><a href="/locations/dubai/difc/">DIFC</a></strong> licenses use specialized financial services terminology with distinct regulatory meaning. <strong>Professional licenses</strong> for consultants and freelancers require activity descriptions that align with MOHRE visa categories. <strong>Foreign company registrations</strong> (UK Companies House, US state filings) require Arabic translation when establishing UAE branches or representative offices. Preserving the attestation chain means ensuring your license translation maintains consistency with <a href="/legal/corporate/moa/">MOA</a> and other corporate documents.</p>

<div class="hero-highlight-box">
  <h4>License Translation Checklist</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Company trade name (Arabic and English consistent)</li>
    <li>License number and issuing authority</li>
    <li>All business activities with standardized terminology</li>
    <li>Shareholder/partner details and ownership percentages</li>
    <li>Manager/authorized signatory names</li>
    <li>Validity dates and renewal status</li>
    <li>Registered address and any branch locations</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3>Document Handling and Consistency</h3>
<p>Trade licenses reference your complete corporate identity—company name, shareholders, activities, and authorization scope. Banks cross-reference license translations against <a href="/legal/corporate/moa/">MOA translations</a>, <a href="/legal/corporate/resolution/">board resolutions</a>, and other corporate documents. Inconsistencies trigger additional verification requests that delay account opening. We maintain corporate document databases to ensure your license translation uses identical company name rendering and terminology as previous translations. For new clients, we confirm preferred transliterations before finalizing documents. Confidential business information—shareholder structures, activity scope, capital details—passes through encrypted channels with restricted access. Only assigned translators handle your documents. We delete files upon request after delivery, maintaining the discretion your business documentation requires.</p>

      <h2>Trade License Translation for Business Operations</h2>
      <p>The trade license is referenced constantly in UAE business—every bank account opening, every visa application, every major contract. The Arabic (or English) translation becomes part of your company's permanent documentation with these institutions.</p>
      
      <p>Business activity translation requires particular attention. Activities determine what your company can legally do, what banking facilities you can access, and what contracts you can sign. We use standardized activity terminology that banks and regulators recognize, avoiding creative translations that might cause confusion.</p>
      
      <p>We maintain consistency across your corporate document set. If you've previously translated your <a href="/legal/corporate/moa/">MOA</a> or other documents with us, we ensure your trade license translation uses the same company name rendering and terminology.</p>

      <h3>Processing Timelines by License Type</h3>
      <p>Standard DED mainland licenses with fewer than 10 activities are completed within 4-6 hours. Free zone licenses from DMCC, JAFZA, or DIFC typically take 4-6 hours as well, depending on activity count. Licenses with extensive activity lists (15 or more activities) require 6-8 hours for thorough terminology verification. Rush service is available for urgent bank meetings—we can expedite most licenses to 2-3 hours with advance notice.</p>

      <p>For bank account opening appointments, we recommend submitting documents at least 48 hours before your scheduled meeting. This allows time for translation, any revisions if needed, and physical printing of certified copies. Digital delivery is immediate upon completion; physical copies with MOJ stamps can be couriered within Dubai the same day.</p>

      <h3>Common Rejection Reasons and Prevention</h3>
      <p>Banks and government entities reject license translations for preventable reasons. Non-standard activity terminology is the most common issue—when translations use creative Arabic phrasing instead of DED-recognized activity descriptions, banks question whether the translation accurately reflects licensed scope. We maintain databases of standardized activity translations that match official DED, DMCC, and other authority terminology.</p>

      <p>Company name inconsistencies cause delays across multiple documents. If your <a href="/legal/corporate/moa/">MOA translation</a> renders your company name differently than your license translation, banks request clarification. We cross-reference existing translations to ensure naming consistency. Shareholder name transliteration follows the same principle—consistent rendering across all corporate documents prevents verification delays.</p>

      <p>Missing information also triggers rejections. Some older licenses or certain free zone formats omit details that banks require. We identify these gaps during review and advise whether additional documentation is needed before proceeding with translation.</p>

      <h3>Free Zone vs Mainland License Considerations</h3>
      <p>Free zone licenses require Arabic translation for any interaction with mainland entities—UAE banks with mainland presence, government ministries, courts, and mainland corporate partners. The reverse applies to DED mainland licenses: international banks, foreign partners, and entities outside the UAE often require certified English translations.</p>

      <p><a href="/locations/dubai/difc/">DIFC</a> presents a unique case. As a common law jurisdiction, DIFC licenses use English legal terminology that requires careful Arabic rendering. Financial services activities have specific regulatory meanings that must translate accurately for <a href="/industries/legal/">UAE Central Bank</a> and other financial regulators. We handle DIFC translations with understanding of both the regulatory context and the Arabic equivalents these authorities accept.</p>
