const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'Why is trade license translation so commonly needed?',
    answer: 'Trade licenses are required for nearly every business interaction in the UAE—bank account opening, visa processing, contract signing, vendor registration, and government submissions. If the original is in Arabic, English translation may be needed. If from a free zone in English, Arabic translation is needed for mainland interactions.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What license types do you translate?',
    answer: 'We translate all UAE license types: DED mainland licenses, DMCC licenses, JAFZA licenses, DIFC licenses, professional licenses, industrial licenses, and licenses from all other free zones. We also translate foreign company registration certificates for UAE use.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How important is business activity translation?',
    answer: 'Critical. Banks and government entities use business activities to determine what your company can do. Mistranslated activities could limit your banking facilities or cause compliance issues. We use standardized activity descriptions that banks and regulators recognize.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How fast can you translate a trade license?',
    answer: 'Standard trade licenses are completed within 4-6 hours. Simple single-page licenses can often be done faster. Licenses with extensive activity lists or multiple pages may take longer. Rush service available for urgent bank meetings.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you translate license amendments?',
    answer: 'Yes. License amendments showing activity additions, shareholder changes, or manager updates need translation to update your records with banks and government entities. We ensure consistency with your original license translation.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What about foreign company registrations?',
    answer: 'We translate foreign company registration certificates (UK Companies House, US state registrations, etc.) into Arabic for UAE use. These are often needed for branch registration, representative office setup, or contract signing.'
