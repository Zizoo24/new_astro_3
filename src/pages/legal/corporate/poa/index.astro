  heroIntro: `<p>Power of Attorney documents grant legal authority to act on your behalf. Whether you need a General POA for broad business management or a Special POA for a specific property transaction at DLD, the translation must accurately convey the <span class="hero-highlight">scope and limitations</span> of authority granted.</p>

<h3>Why Every Word Matters</h3>
<p>A POA grants someone else the legal authority to sign contracts, sell property, manage bank accounts, or make binding decisions in your name. A vague translation could grant broader authority than intended. An overly narrow translation could prevent necessary actions. UAE institutions examine POA translations closely because errors have significant consequences—rejected transactions, delayed closings, or worse.</p>

<h3>POA Types and Uses</h3>
<div class="hero-feature-grid">
<div class="hero-feature-item"><strong>General POA</strong> Broad authority across property, banking, contracts, and legal representation for extended absences</div>
<div class="hero-feature-item"><strong>Special POA</strong> Limited to specific transactions—selling one property, managing one account</div>
<div class="hero-feature-item"><strong>Property POA</strong> DLD-specific format for buying, selling, mortgaging, or leasing real estate</div>
<div class="hero-feature-item"><strong>Banking POA</strong> Explicit powers for account management, transfers, loans, and signatory authority</div>
<div class="hero-feature-item"><strong>Litigation POA</strong> Authority to represent in court proceedings and legal matters</div>
<div class="hero-feature-item"><strong>Corporate POA</strong> Business operations, company representation, and commercial activities</div>
</div>

<div class="hero-divider">General vs Special POA</div>

<table class="hero-table">
<thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Scope</th><th>UAE Preference</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>General POA</td><td>Broad authority—property, banking, legal</td><td>Acceptable, higher scrutiny</td></tr>
<tr><td>Special POA</td><td>Single transaction or purpose</td><td>Preferred for major deals</td></tr>
<tr><td>Property-Specific</td><td>One unit, one transaction type</td><td>Required by DLD</td></tr>
</tbody>

<h3>DLD Property Requirements</h3>
<p>The Dubai Land Department is strict about POA documentation. Property-specific POAs must clearly identify the exact unit (plot number, building name, unit identifier) and the authorized transaction type—sale, purchase, mortgage, or lease. The agent's authority must be spelled out explicitly in both the original and the Arabic translation. Many <a href="/locations/dubai/palm-jumeirah/">Palm Jumeirah</a> and <a href="/locations/dubai/downtown/">Downtown Dubai</a> property owners rely on Special POAs for off-plan transactions.</p>

<h3>Banking POA Standards</h3>
<p>UAE banks require POAs that explicitly state which operations the agent can perform. Generic language like "manage my banking affairs" is insufficient. Banks want specific powers listed: opening accounts, issuing cheques, managing investments, accessing safe deposit boxes, signing loan documents. We translate to meet these institutional expectations.</p>

<blockquote class="hero-pullquote">If DLD, any UAE bank, or court rejects our POA translation due to our error, we correct and redeliver at no charge—including courier costs to meet your deadline.</blockquote>

<h3>Attestation Requirements</h3>
<p>Foreign POAs typically require <a href="/services/attestation/">attestation</a>: notarization in home country, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, UAE Embassy, and UAE MOFA. Countries in the <a href="/services/attestation/apostille/">Hague Apostille Convention</a> follow a simpler process. We verify attestation status during pre-validation and advise on additional steps needed before your transaction date.</p>

      <h2>What You Need to Know About Power of Attorney Translation</h2>

      <div class="content-prose">
        <h3>Why POA Translation Requires Special Attention</h3>
        <p>A Power of Attorney is not a simple document to translate. It grants someone else the legal authority to act in your name—to sign contracts, sell property, manage bank accounts, or make decisions that bind you legally. Every word matters. A vague translation could grant broader authority than intended. An overly narrow translation could prevent necessary actions.</p>

        <p>UAE institutions take POA documentation seriously. The Dubai Land Department rejects property transactions where the POA scope is unclear. Banks refuse to process transactions when the specific banking powers are not explicitly stated. Courts examine POA translations closely in dispute situations.</p>

        <h3>General vs. Special Power of Attorney in UAE</h3>
        <p>Understanding the distinction between General and Special POAs is essential for UAE transactions:</p>

        <p><strong>General Power of Attorney:</strong> Grants broad authority across multiple areas—property, banking, <a href="/legal/contracts/">contracts</a>, legal representation. This is useful when you need someone to handle various affairs during extended absence. However, UAE institutions often prefer specific POAs for major transactions because they reduce the risk of unauthorized actions.</p>

        <p><strong>Special Power of Attorney:</strong> Limits authority to defined transactions. A property-specific POA might authorize your agent only to sell Unit 1234 in Building XYZ on Palm Jumeirah. A banking POA might only allow checking balance and issuing certain types of payments. UAE prefers this approach for significant transactions.</p>

        <h3>Property POAs for DLD Transactions</h3>
        <p>The Dubai Land Department has specific expectations for POAs used in property transactions. Your translation must include:</p>

        <ul class="content-list">
          <li><strong>Property identification:</strong> Plot number, building name, unit number, community/development name</li>
          <li><strong>Transaction type:</strong> Sale, purchase, mortgage, lease, or other specific actions authorized</li>
          <li><strong>Agent details:</strong> Full name, passport/Emirates ID, nationality of the authorized agent</li>
          <li><strong>Principal details:</strong> Your information matching exactly with property records</li>
          <li><strong>Scope limitations:</strong> Any conditions, price ranges, or timeframes specified</li>
          <li><strong>Signatures and notarization:</strong> Accurate description of authentication elements</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We format POA translations to meet DLD submission standards. Many <a href="/locations/dubai/palm-jumeirah/">Palm Jumeirah</a>, <a href="/locations/dubai/marina/">Marina</a>, and <a href="/locations/dubai/downtown/">Downtown</a> property owners use our services for remote transactions.</p>

        <h3>Banking POAs in the UAE</h3>
        <p>UAE banks require POAs that explicitly state which banking operations the agent can perform. Ambiguous language causes rejection. Common banking powers include:</p>

        <ul class="content-list">
          <li>Opening or closing accounts</li>
          <li>Depositing and withdrawing funds</li>
          <li>Issuing cheques and managing payments</li>
          <li>Accessing safe deposit boxes</li>
          <li>Managing investments and securities</li>
          <li>Loan applications and mortgage signing</li>
          <li>Adding or removing account signatories</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If your POA was drafted for general use in another country, it may need supplementary documentation or redrafting to satisfy UAE banking requirements. We review every POA and advise on potential issues before translation.</p>

        <h3>Attestation Requirements for Foreign POAs</h3>
        <p>POAs issued abroad require <a href="/services/attestation/">attestation</a> before UAE institutions will accept them. The process depends on where the POA was created:</p>

        <p><strong>Hague Convention Countries (UK, USA, India, Canada, Australia):</strong> Your POA receives an apostille from the issuing country's competent authority. For UAE use, this typically still requires UAE Embassy attestation and MOFA/MOFAIC attestation within the UAE.</p>

        <p><strong>Non-Hague Countries:</strong> Traditional attestation chain applies—notarization, Ministry of Foreign Affairs in issuing country, UAE Embassy attestation, then MOFA in UAE.</p>

        <p>We verify attestation status during pre-validation. Missing attestation steps discovered after translation cause delays and additional costs.</p>

        <h3>POAs Created in the UAE</h3>
        <p>If you create a POA through a UAE Notary Public, it will be in Arabic. You might need an English translation if:</p>

        <ul class="content-list">
          <li>Your agent needs to understand the document but doesn't read Arabic</li>
          <li>You're dealing with international banks or companies that require English documentation</li>
          <li>The transaction involves foreign parties or jurisdictions</li>
          <li>You want records in both languages for your files</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Revocation of Power of Attorney</h3>
        <p>When you need to cancel a previously issued POA, the revocation document requires translation if it will be used across languages. Proper revocation ensures:</p>

        <ul class="content-list">
          <li>Third parties (banks, DLD, courts) are informed the POA is no longer valid</li>
          <li>Your former agent cannot continue acting on your behalf</li>
          <li>Clear records exist of when authority was terminated</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We translate revocation documents with the same precision as original POAs, ensuring all parties understand the authority has ended.</p>

        <h3>Timeline and Urgent Situations</h3>
        <p>Standard POA translation completes within 24 hours. This suits routine planning and scheduled transactions.</p>

        <p>Express service delivers in 6 hours for time-sensitive transactions. Many clients use this when property closings approach or bank appointments are scheduled.</p>

        <p>VIP Concierge provides 1-hour drafts for immediate needs. If you have a signing scheduled today or an urgent DLD appointment, we can accommodate with advance notice.</p>

        <div class="info-callout">
          <h4><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Complete Property Transaction Support</h4>
          <p>Property transactions often require multiple translated documents: POA, <a href="/services/title-deed-translation-dubai/">title deed</a>, <a href="/legal/contracts/spa/">sale agreement</a>, and potentially <a href="/legal/corporate/moa/">company documents</a> if the property is held through a corporate structure.
