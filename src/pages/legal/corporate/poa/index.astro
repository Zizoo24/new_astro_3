      question: "What is the difference between General and Special Power of Attorney?",
      answer: "A General Power of Attorney grants broad authority across multiple matters including property, banking, and legal affairs. A Special Power of Attorney limits authority to specific transactions such as selling a particular property. In the UAE, Special POAs are preferred for property transactions because they clearly define the scope and reduce potential disputes."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this POA translation accepted by DLD?",
      answer: "Yes. Our MOJ-certified POA translations are accepted by the Dubai Land Department for property transactions. The translation includes all required elements: property details, transaction type, parties involved, and the official MOJ stamp with QR verification."
    },
    {
      question: "Does my foreign POA need attestation?",
      answer: "For most official UAE uses, yes. POAs issued abroad typically need attestation through notarization, home country Ministry of Foreign Affairs, UAE Embassy, and UAE MOFA. We check attestation status during our free pre-validation review before you pay for translation."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does POA translation take?",
      answer: "Standard service delivers within 24 hours. Express service completes in 6 hours for urgent transactions. VIP Concierge provides 1-hour drafts when you have an immediate closing or bank appointment."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you help with notarization as well?",
      answer: "We focus on translation services. However, we can advise on the notarization process and timing. Many clients get the translation first, then proceed to the UAE Notary Public if the POA needs to be re-notarized locally."
