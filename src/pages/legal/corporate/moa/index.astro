      question: "What is the difference between a Mainland MOA and a Freezone MOA?",
      answer: "A Mainland MOA is registered with DED and follows UAE Commercial Companies Law, with specific provisions about capital, partners, and profit distribution. Freezone MOAs are governed by the respective free zone authority with provisions specific to that zone. We adapt translation terminology to match the regulatory context of your company structure."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this translation accepted for bank account opening?",
      answer: "Yes. Our MOJ-certified MOA translations are accepted by all major UAE banks for corporate account opening. The translation includes all elements banks require: ownership structure, authorized signatories, capital details, and the official MOJ stamp."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you translate MOA amendments separately?",
      answer: "We can translate your current consolidated MOA, or we can translate the original MOA plus each amendment separately, depending on your needs. Let us know how the documents will be used and we will advise on the appropriate approach."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does MOA translation take?",
      answer: "Standard service delivers within 24 hours for typical MOAs. Express service completes in 6 hours. Complex MOAs with multiple schedules or lengthy shareholder agreements may require additional time, which we confirm upfront."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you translate MOAs from other countries?",
      answer: "Yes. We translate corporate formation documents from companies registered in any country. Foreign MOAs typically need attestation for use in the UAE. We verify attestation status during our pre-validation review."
