  {
    question: "What types of contracts do you translate?",
    answer: "We translate all commercial and civil contracts for UAE use. These include NDAs, sale-purchase agreements (SPAs), MOUs, commercial leases for Ejari, employment contracts for MOHRE, service agreements, joint ventures, franchise agreements, and distribution contracts. Each translation includes MOJ certification with stamp and QR code."
  },
  {
    question: "Do translated contracts have legal validity in UAE courts?",
    answer: "Yes. MOJ-certified translations carry full legal weight in Dubai Courts, Abu Dhabi courts, DIFC Courts, ADGM Courts, and all government entities. Each includes the translator's stamp, signature, serial number, and QR code. Authorities verify authenticity by scanning the code. Without certification, translated contracts have no legal standing."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I get contracts translated before or after signing?",
    answer: "Both are common. Translate before signing when parties need to understand terms in their native language—useful for joint ventures. Translate after signing when the contract is for court, filings, or registrations. We advise on timing during our document review."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle specialized contract terminology?",
    answer: "Our translators have UAE commercial law backgrounds. We maintain glossaries for different contract types: real estate terms for SPAs, IP terminology for NDAs, and governance language for shareholder agreements. This ensures consistent, accurate terminology throughout."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you translate contracts in languages other than Arabic and English?",
    answer: "Yes. We translate from and into French, German, Russian, Chinese, Hindi, Urdu, Spanish, Portuguese, and 35+ other languages. All receive MOJ certification. For trilingual contracts, we ensure terminology stays consistent across all three versions."
  },
  {
    question: "What is bilingual contract formatting and when is it required?",
    answer: "Bilingual formatting shows Arabic and English side-by-side in parallel columns. Dubai Courts require this format for most submissions. Both versions carry equal authority. We produce documents with proper alignment, consistent pagination, and matching clause numbers."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does contract translation take?",
    answer: "Standard contracts (5-15 pages) complete in 24-48 hours. Complex agreements may need 3-5 business days. For urgent matters—court deadlines or closings—we offer express processing. Contact us with your deadline. We will confirm availability before you commit."
  },
  {
    question: "What if there are errors or ambiguities in the original contract?",
    answer: "We translate exactly what appears in your document, including errors. But we flag issues: inconsistent names, missing signatures, undefined terms, math errors, or contradicting clauses. This helps you catch problems before court submission. We document findings in our delivery notes."

      <h2>Why Contract Translation Requires Legal Expertise</h2>
      
      <p>A contract is not simply text—it is a precise allocation of rights, obligations, and remedies between parties. Every word carries legal weight. When translated incorrectly, a contract can become unenforceable, expose parties to unintended liability, or fail to protect the interests it was designed to secure.</p>
      
      <h3>The Precision Problem</h3>
      
      <p>Consider the difference between "shall" and "may" in English legal drafting. "Shall" creates an obligation; "may" creates an option. Arabic legal language has its own distinctions—يجب (yajib, must/shall) versus يجوز (yajuz, may/permitted). A translator unfamiliar with these conventions might render both as simple future tense, fundamentally altering the contract's meaning and potentially shifting millions of dirhams in liability.</p>
      
      <p>This precision extends to defined terms, cross-references, and interpretation clauses. A well-drafted contract uses defined terms consistently throughout; a competent translation must mirror this consistency exactly. When Clause 5.2 references "the Property" as defined in Clause 1.1, the Arabic translation must use the identical defined term—not a synonym that could introduce ambiguity in court proceedings.</p>
      
      <h3>Jurisdiction-Specific Requirements</h3>
      
      <p>UAE contracts may be governed by different legal frameworks depending on where disputes are resolved. Dubai Courts operate under UAE civil law, with Arabic as the official language of proceedings. DIFC and ADGM operate under common law frameworks derived from English law, with English as the primary language. A contract destined for DIFC arbitration requires different terminology than one subject to Dubai Courts jurisdiction.</p>
      
      <p>Our translators understand these distinctions. They know that "specific performance" in common law does not directly translate to UAE civil law concepts. They recognize when a contract's governing law clause affects how terms should be rendered. This jurisdictional awareness prevents translations that technically render words but miss legal meaning—the kind of error that surfaces only when the contract is tested in dispute.</p>
      
      <div class="category-info-box">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-columns"></i> Bilingual Formatting Standards</h3>
        <p>UAE courts and government entities often require bilingual contracts with Arabic and English in parallel columns. This side-by-side format allows authorities to verify that both versions align and grants equal interpretive weight to each language. We produce bilingual documents that meet Dubai Courts formatting requirements: proper column alignment, consistent pagination, matching clause numbering, and clear visual hierarchy. The format matters—improperly formatted bilingual documents may be rejected at filing.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="category-info-box">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-stamp"></i> MOJ Certification Process</h3>
        <p>Every contract translation receives official Ministry of Justice certification. This includes the translator's registered stamp, personal signature, unique serial number, and QR verification code that authorities scan to confirm authenticity. The certification transforms a document from a mere translation into legally recognized evidence. Without MOJ certification, your translated contract has no standing in UAE courts, cannot be used for government registrations, and will be rejected by banks and regulatory bodies.</p>

      <h2>Common Contract Translation Scenarios</h2>
      
      <h3>Real Estate Transactions</h3>
      <p>Property purchases in Dubai require translated SPAs for Dubai Land Department (DLD) registration. The translation must accurately render payment schedules (often tied to construction milestones for off-plan properties), handover conditions, penalty clauses for delays, developer obligations, and buyer rights. For secondary market transactions, the SPA translation must match the title deed details exactly. We format translations to DLD submission requirements, preventing registration delays that can jeopardize transaction timelines.</p>
      
      <h3>Business Partnerships and Joint Ventures</h3>
      <p>Joint ventures, franchise agreements, and distribution contracts often involve parties from different language backgrounds. A bilingual contract ensures both parties understand their obligations without relying on the other party's interpretation. This is particularly important for profit-sharing arrangements, management rights, exit mechanisms, and dispute resolution procedures. We maintain consistency between language versions so that both have equal legal authority—critical when disputes arise and courts must determine which version governs.</p>
      
      <h3>Employment Relationships</h3>
      <p>MOHRE requires Arabic employment contracts for visa processing and labour dispute resolution. The translation must accurately specify salary components (basic salary, housing allowance, transportation allowance, other benefits), notice periods, probation terms, end-of-service gratuity calculations, and any non-compete or confidentiality restrictions. Errors in these areas affect visa applications, gratuity calculations in termination scenarios, and outcomes in labour court proceedings. We verify that translated terms match MOHRE's standard contract requirements.</p>
      
      <h3>Dispute Resolution and Litigation</h3>
      <p>When contracts become the subject of litigation or arbitration, the translated version may be scrutinized by judges, arbitrators, and opposing counsel looking for weaknesses. A professionally translated contract with MOJ certification demonstrates that the parties relied on an accurate rendering of terms. It also prevents disputes about what the contract actually says—both language versions are treated as authoritative when properly certified. For ongoing litigation, we can provide expert commentary on translation choices if questions arise about specific terms.</p>

      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <span class="timeline-title">1. Document Review and Assessment</span>
          <p>Send your contract via WhatsApp or email. We analyze the document's structure, identify defined terms and cross-references, note the governing law and jurisdiction, and flag any specialized terminology. This review ensures we assign the right translator—someone with experience in your contract type—and provide an accurate quote and timeline. We will tell you upfront if we see potential issues with the source document.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <span class="timeline-title">2. Translation by Legal Specialist</span>
          <p>An MOJ-licensed legal translator with relevant subject matter expertise renders your contract. They maintain consistency with your defined terms, preserve the precise allocation of rights and obligations, and use jurisdiction-appropriate terminology. For complex contracts, the translator may consult with colleagues on specific clauses—we encourage this collaboration because it produces better results than working in isolation.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <span class="timeline-title">3. Quality Review and Verification</span>
          <p>A second translator reviews the work against the source document. They verify terminology consistency throughout, check that cross-references work correctly in the translation, confirm that legal concepts translate accurately, and ensure formatting meets submission requirements. Any ambiguities or issues in the source document are documented for your attention. This step catches errors that even experienced translators occasionally make.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <span class="timeline-title">4. Certification and Delivery</span>
          <p>The official MOJ stamp and QR verification code are applied. You receive the certified translation digitally via WhatsApp and email for immediate use. Physical copies with original stamps can be couriered anywhere in the UAE—same-day delivery is available in Dubai. For bilingual documents, we ensure the final formatting meets court submission standards before delivery.</p>
