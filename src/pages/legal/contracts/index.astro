    question: 'What types of contracts do you translate?',
    answer: 'We translate all commercial and civil contracts including NDAs, sale-purchase agreements (SPAs), memoranda of understanding (MOUs), lease agreements, employment contracts, service agreements, joint venture contracts, franchise agreements, and shareholder agreements. All translations are MOJ-certified for UAE legal enforceability.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do translated contracts have legal validity in UAE courts?',
    answer: 'Yes. When translated by an MOJ-certified legal translator, your contract translation carries full legal weight in UAE courts, DIFC, ADGM, and all government entities. The translation includes the official MOJ stamp, translator signature, and unique serial number that authorities verify for authenticity.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I get contracts translated before or after signing?',
    answer: 'We recommend translating contracts before signing when both parties need to understand the terms in their native language. For court submissions or regulatory filings, translation is typically done after execution. We can advise on the optimal timing based on your specific use case.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle specialized contract terminology?',
    answer: 'Our legal translators have backgrounds in UAE commercial law and understand jurisdiction-specific terminology. We maintain glossaries for different contract types—real estate terms for SPAs, IP terminology for NDAs, corporate governance language for shareholder agreements. This ensures consistent, accurate terminology throughout.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate contracts in languages other than Arabic and English?',
    answer: 'Yes. While Arabic-English is our most common pairing, we translate contracts from and into 43+ languages including French, German, Russian, Chinese, Hindi, Urdu, and more. Multi-language contracts follow the same MOJ certification process.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is bilingual contract formatting?',
    answer: 'Bilingual formatting presents Arabic and English text in parallel columns on the same page. This is the standard format required by Dubai Courts and many government entities. It allows readers to compare terms side-by-side and ensures both language versions are treated as equally authoritative.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does contract translation take?',
    answer: 'Standard contracts (5-15 pages) are typically completed within 24-48 hours. Complex agreements with technical schedules may require 3-5 business days. Express processing is available for urgent matters—contact us for rush timelines.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if there are errors in the original contract?',
    answer: 'We translate what is written in the source document, even if it contains errors. However, we flag obvious inconsistencies, missing information, or potential issues for your review. This quality check has helped clients catch problems before court submission.'

      <h2>Why Contract Translation Requires Legal Expertise</h2>
      
      <p>A contract is not simply text—it is a precise allocation of rights, obligations, and remedies between parties. Every word carries legal weight. When translated incorrectly, a contract can become unenforceable, expose parties to unintended liability, or fail to protect the interests it was designed to secure.</p>
      
      <h3>The Precision Problem</h3>
      
      <p>Consider the difference between "shall" and "may" in English legal drafting. "Shall" creates an obligation; "may" creates an option. Arabic legal language has its own distinctions—يجب (must/shall) versus يجوز (may/permitted). A translator unfamiliar with these conventions might render both as simple future tense, fundamentally altering the contract's meaning.</p>
      
      <p>This precision extends to defined terms, cross-references, and interpretation clauses. A well-drafted contract uses defined terms consistently; a competent translation must mirror this consistency. When Clause 5.2 references "the Property" as defined in Clause 1.1, the Arabic translation must use the identical defined term—not a synonym that could introduce ambiguity.</p>
      
      <h3>Jurisdiction-Specific Requirements</h3>
      
      <p>UAE contracts may be governed by different legal frameworks depending on where disputes are resolved. Dubai Courts operate under UAE civil law, with Arabic as the official language. DIFC and ADGM operate under common law frameworks with English as the primary language. A contract destined for DIFC arbitration requires different terminology than one subject to Dubai Courts jurisdiction.</p>
      
      <p>Our translators understand these distinctions. They know that "specific performance" in common law doesn't directly translate to UAE civil law concepts. They recognize when a contract's governing law clause affects how terms should be rendered. This jurisdictional awareness prevents translations that technically render words but miss legal meaning.</p>
      
      <div class="category-info-box">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-columns"></i> Bilingual Formatting Standards</h3>
        <p>UAE courts and government entities often require bilingual contracts with Arabic and English in parallel columns. This side-by-side format allows authorities to verify that both versions align and grants equal interpretive weight to each language. We produce bilingual documents that meet Dubai Courts formatting requirements, with proper alignment, consistent pagination, and clear visual hierarchy.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="category-info-box">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-stamp"></i> MOJ Certification Process</h3>
        <p>Every contract translation receives official Ministry of Justice certification. This includes the translator's registered stamp, personal signature, unique serial number, and QR verification code. Government entities scan this code to confirm the translation's authenticity. Without MOJ certification, your translated contract has no legal standing in UAE courts or regulatory proceedings.</p>

      <h2>Common Contract Translation Scenarios</h2>
      
      <h3>Real Estate Transactions</h3>
      <p>Property purchases in Dubai require translated SPAs for Dubai Land Department (DLD) registration. The translation must accurately render payment schedules, handover conditions, penalty clauses, and developer obligations. For off-plan purchases, milestone payments tied to construction progress must be clearly specified. We format translations to match DLD submission requirements, preventing registration delays.</p>
      
      <h3>Business Partnerships</h3>
      <p>Joint ventures, franchise agreements, and distribution contracts often involve parties from different language backgrounds. A bilingual contract ensures both parties understand their obligations without relying on the other's interpretation. We maintain consistency between language versions so that both have equal legal authority—critical when disputes arise and courts must determine which version governs.</p>
      
      <h3>Employment Relationships</h3>
      <p>MOHRE requires Arabic employment contracts for visa processing and labour dispute resolution. The translation must accurately specify salary components (basic, allowances, benefits), notice periods, end-of-service gratuity calculations, and non-compete restrictions. Errors in these areas can affect visa applications, gratuity calculations, and labour court proceedings.</p>
      
      <h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
      <p>When contracts become the subject of litigation or arbitration, the translated version may be scrutinized by courts, arbitrators, and opposing counsel. A professionally translated contract with MOJ certification demonstrates that the parties relied on an accurate rendering. It also prevents disputes about what the contract actually says—both language versions are treated as authoritative when properly certified.</p>
