      <h2>Employment Documents We Translate</h2>
      <div class="content-prose">
        <p>Employment relationships generate numerous documents requiring translation. From the initial offer letter through contract signing, renewals, and eventual termination or resignation, each stage may require Arabic translation for official purposes.</p>
        
        <h3>Employment Contracts</h3>
        <p>The core employment contract defines the relationship between employer and employee. Under UAE labor law, certain provisions must be included—job title, salary, working hours, leave entitlements, and notice periods. When disputes arise, the Arabic version often takes precedence in labor courts, making accurate translation essential.</p>
        
        <p>We translate unlimited contracts (permanent positions), limited contracts (fixed-term), and free zone employment agreements. Each type has different implications under UAE law, and our translators understand these distinctions when handling the documents.</p>
        
        <h3>Offer Letters and Appointment Documents</h3>
        <p>Offer letters confirm employment terms before the formal contract is signed. While less formal than contracts, they may be referenced in disputes about agreed terms. We translate offer letters to ensure employees understand their commitments and employers have documentation for their records.</p>
        
        <h3>Contract Amendments and Addendums</h3>
        <p>When employment terms change—salary adjustments, role changes, or updated benefits—amendment documents formalize these changes. We translate amendments to maintain complete employment records in both languages.</p>
        
        <h3>Termination and Resignation Documents</h3>
        <p>End-of-service documentation requires particular care. Termination letters must accurately state the reason for termination, as this affects gratuity calculations and the employee's ability to obtain new employment. Resignation acceptances confirm the employment end date and outstanding entitlements. We translate these documents with attention to their legal implications.</p>
        
        <h3>Final Settlement Documents</h3>
        <p>Upon employment termination, settlement documents calculate gratuity, leave encashment, and other final payments. These calculations follow specific formulas under UAE labor law. Accurate translation ensures both parties understand what is being agreed in the final settlement.</p>

      <h2>When Translation is Required</h2>
      <div class="content-prose">
        <h3>Visa Processing</h3>
        <p>Employment visas require submission of the employment contract to immigration authorities. While some free zones accept English documents, mainland companies typically need Arabic versions. We provide certified translations that meet MOHRE (Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation) requirements.</p>
        
        <h3>Labor Court Cases</h3>
        <p>Labor disputes in UAE courts require all documents in Arabic. Employment contracts, correspondence, and evidence documents need certified translation for court submission. Courts may request translations of email exchanges, performance reviews, or any document relevant to the dispute.</p>
        
        <h3>Bank Requirements</h3>
        <p>Banks may request translated employment contracts for loan applications, credit cards, or account opening. The translation confirms income, employment stability, and employer details that banks evaluate for lending decisions.</p>
        
        <h3>Government Services</h3>
        <p>Various government services—from family visa applications to housing allowances—may require employment documentation. Certified translations ensure these documents are accepted without question.</p>
        
        <h3>Internal HR Compliance</h3>
        <p>Companies with Arabic-speaking employees may maintain bilingual employment records for clarity. This ensures employees fully understand their contractual obligations and rights, reducing misunderstandings that could lead to disputes.</p>

      <h2>Free Zone vs Mainland Employment</h2>
      <div class="content-prose">
        <p>The UAE has two main employment frameworks—mainland companies under MOHRE jurisdiction and free zone companies under their respective free zone authorities. Translation requirements and document formats differ between these systems.</p>
        
        <h3>Mainland Employment</h3>
        <p>Mainland companies register employment contracts with MOHRE. While the system accepts English submissions, Arabic contracts are standard for court proceedings and many government interactions. We translate mainland employment contracts following MOHRE terminology and format conventions.</p>
        
        <h3>Free Zone Employment</h3>
        <p>Free zones like DMCC, JAFZA, DAFZA, and Dubai Internet City have their own employment regulations and templates. Some free zones use primarily English documentation, while others require Arabic versions. We understand the requirements of major UAE free zones and translate accordingly.</p>
        
        <h3>DIFC and ADGM</h3>
        <p>The financial free zones (DIFC and ADGM) operate under common law principles with English as the primary language. However, translated documents may still be needed for UAE courts outside these zones, immigration processing, or personal matters. We handle both common law and civil law employment terminology.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Which version prevails if there are discrepancies between English and Arabic contracts?</h3>
          <p>In UAE labor courts, the Arabic version typically prevails for mainland employment. This makes accurate translation crucial—the Arabic version should precisely reflect the intended terms, not introduce ambiguities or unintended changes.</p>
        </div>
