  faqs: [
    {
      question: "How do you handle multi-party NDAs with more than two signatories?",
      answer: "We carefully translate the definitions section to ensure each party is consistently identified throughout the Arabic version, and verify that mutual versus unilateral obligations are clearly distinguished. For joint venture or consortium NDAs, we ensure carve-outs for affiliates and related parties are accurately rendered."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this NDA translation enforceable in UAE courts?",
      answer: "Yes. Our MOJ-certified NDA translations are accepted by UAE courts for legal proceedings. The translation includes the official stamp and translator credentials required for court submission. For DIFC or ADGM disputes, the same translation serves as evidence of the agreement terms."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you translate NDAs with technical or scientific terms?",
      answer: "Yes. We frequently translate NDAs in technology, pharmaceutical, engineering, and other technical fields. Our translators handle industry-specific terminology for intellectual property, trade secrets, and proprietary processes."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does NDA translation take?",
      answer: "Standard service delivers within 24 hours for typical NDAs. Express service completes in 6 hours. Complex multi-party agreements or NDAs with extensive schedules may require additional time, which we confirm upfront."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you translate NDAs in languages other than English?",
      answer: "Yes. We translate NDAs from any language into Arabic (and vice versa). For non-English NDAs, we can provide Arabic translation directly or work through English as an intermediary if required by your legal team."
