  heroIntro: `<p>Moving to Dubai means paperwork. Visa applications, family sponsorship, school enrollment, driving license conversion—each requires specific documents translated and attested to UAE standards. This guide covers every personal document you need and how to avoid rejection at government counters.</p>

<h3>The UAE Runs on Documentation</h3>
<p>Every interaction with government authorities—<strong>GDRFA</strong> for visas, <strong>MOHRE</strong> for work permits, <strong>RTA</strong> for driving licenses, <strong>KHDA</strong> for school enrollment—requires properly translated and often attested documents. Arabic is the official language of all UAE government proceedings. Getting it right the first time saves weeks of frustration.</p>

<h3>Vital Records</h3>
<p><a href="/personal/vital-records/">Vital records</a> form the foundation of your UAE administrative identity. <a href="/personal/vital-records/birth/">Birth certificates</a> establish dependent visa eligibility. <a href="/personal/vital-records/marriage/">Marriage certificates</a> prove relationship for spouse sponsorship. <a href="/personal/vital-records/divorce/">Divorce certificates</a> update civil status. <a href="/personal/vital-records/death/">Death certificates</a> enable estate settlement. Each requires MOJ-certified Arabic translation.</p>

<h3>Academic Credentials</h3>
<p><a href="/personal/academic/degree/">Academic credentials</a>—degree certificates, diplomas, and <a href="/personal/academic/transcripts/">transcripts</a>—are required for employment and professional licensing. MOHRE cannot process work permits without translated qualifications. Professional licensing bodies (DHA, Dubai Courts) require attested credentials before you can practice.</p>

<h3>Immigration Documents</h3>
<p><a href="/personal/immigration/">Immigration documents</a> support visa applications and daily life. <a href="/personal/immigration/pcc/">Police clearance</a> proves good conduct. <a href="/personal/immigration/bank/">Bank statements</a> demonstrate financial capacity for Golden Visa. <a href="/personal/immigration/license/">Driving license</a> translation enables RTA conversion without the full test.</p>

<h3>Attestation Requirements</h3>
<p><a href="/services/attestation/">Attestation</a> adds complexity. Most documents need authentication: home country notarization, Foreign Ministry certification, UAE Embassy attestation, and UAE MOFA attestation. Without this chain, documents lack the authentication UAE authorities require. We help coordinate the process.</p>

<h3>Name Consistency—The Biggest Rejection Cause</h3>
<p>GDRFA's system matches names character by character. If your birth certificate says "Mohammad" but your passport says "Mohammed," the system flags a mismatch. We check name consistency before translation and advise on resolutions—sometimes a statutory declaration, sometimes embassy documentation.</p>

<h3>What This Guide Covers</h3>
<p>We walk through each document type with specific UAE requirements, attestation chains by country, common rejection reasons and how to avoid them, and realistic timelines. Whether you're a new expatriate or long-term resident, we translate with the precision UAE authorities demand.</p>

  // FAQs
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Which personal documents need translation for a UAE visa?",
      answer: "For a standard employment visa: passport (sometimes), educational degree, and police clearance certificate. For family/dependent visa: marriage certificate, children's birth certificates. For Golden Visa: all of the above plus bank statements and property documents. Each document must be MOJ-certified Arabic translation."
    },
    {
      question: "Do my documents need attestation before translation?",
      answer: "It depends on the document and its intended use. Birth/marriage certificates for GDRFA submission typically need MOFA attestation first. Degrees for employment need full attestation chain. We check your document and advise whether attestation is required before you pay for translation."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does personal document translation take?",
      answer: "Standard documents (birth certificate, marriage certificate, single-page certificates): 60 minutes for digital delivery. Multi-page documents (transcripts, bank statements): 2-4 hours. Hard copy with MOJ stamp: same-day if submitted before 12pm, next morning otherwise."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use a phone photo of my document?",
      answer: "Yes, for the initial quote and translation. The photo must show all four corners, be in focus, and have good lighting. For the final hard copy submission to government, you will need the original document — we will guide you on this."
    },
    {
      question: "What if the government office rejects my translation?",
      answer: "This rarely happens with our MOJ-certified translations, but if it does, we investigate the reason and provide a corrected translation at no additional cost. Common issues are spelling variations (Mohammad vs Muhammad) which we can adjust to match your other documents."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you translate documents from all languages?",
      answer: "We specialize in translation to and from Arabic, which is what UAE government authorities require. For documents in languages other than English (Hindi, Urdu, Tagalog, French, etc.), we translate to Arabic via our certified linguists in those language pairs."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between certified and legal translation?",
      answer: "In UAE context, legal translation specifically means translation by a translator licensed by the Ministry of Justice (MOJ). This is what courts, GDRFA, and government departments require. 'Certified' without MOJ licensing is not accepted for official purposes in UAE."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you help with document attestation too?",
      answer: "Yes. We coordinate the full attestation process for documents from India, UK, US, Philippines, Pakistan, and other countries. This includes home country attestation, UAE Embassy legalization, and MOFA stamping. See our attestation guide for country-specific requirements."

        <h2>Understanding UAE Document Requirements</h2>
        
        <p>The UAE operates a structured system for foreign document acceptance. Understanding this system saves time, money, and frustration at government counters.</p>
        
        <h3>The Three-Layer Verification System</h3>
        
        <p>For most personal documents submitted to UAE government authorities, three elements must be in place:</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Attestation/Apostille</strong> — Proves the document is genuine. This happens in your home country through your Ministry of Foreign Affairs or via apostille for Hague Convention countries.</li>
          <li><strong>UAE Embassy Legalization</strong> — The UAE Embassy in your home country verifies the attestation. This step is being phased out for some document types from apostille countries.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal Translation</strong> — An MOJ-licensed translator converts the document to Arabic, applying the official stamp and QR verification code.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>The order matters. Translation should typically be the last step, after attestation, because the translation must include the attestation stamps to be complete.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Not sure about your document's status?</strong> Send it via WhatsApp and we will tell you exactly what is needed before you pay anything.</p>
        
        <h3>Document Requirements by Visa Type</h3>
        
        <p>Different visa categories require different document sets. Here is what you will typically need:</p>

        </ul>
        
        <h3>Country-Specific Attestation Paths</h3>
        
        <p>The attestation process varies significantly by country. We have prepared detailed guides for the most common origin countries:</p>

        <h3>Common Mistakes That Cause Rejection</h3>
        
        <p>After processing thousands of personal documents, we have identified the issues that most frequently cause rejection at government counters:</p>
        
        <h4>1. Name Spelling Inconsistencies</h4>
        <p>Your name must be spelled identically across all documents. Mohammad, Mohammed, and Muhammad are treated as different names by UAE systems. We check this during our pre-validation and can advise on which spelling to use throughout.</p>
        
        <h4>2. Missing Attestation Stamps</h4>
        <p>A beautifully translated document is useless if the original was not attested first. We check for attestation stamps before accepting your document for translation.</p>
        
        <h4>3. Expired Documents</h4>
        <p>Police clearance certificates typically must be issued within 6 months. Bank statements must be recent (usually within 3 months of application). We flag expiration issues before you waste money on translation.</p>
        
        <h4>4. Wrong Document Type</h4>
        <p>A "marriage certificate" from a religious authority may not be accepted without civil registration. Degree "provisional certificates" are not the same as the final degree. We advise when you need to obtain a different document.</p>
        
        <h3>What Happens After Translation</h3>
        
        <p>Once you have your translated document, the next steps depend on your purpose:</p>
        
        <h4>For GDRFA/Immigration</h4>
        <p>Upload the translated document through the GDRFA portal or ICP app. The QR code on our translation allows online verification. Keep the hard copy for any in-person appointments.</p>
        
        <h4>For Dubai Courts</h4>
        <p>Submit the original document plus translation. Our translations follow Dubai Courts formatting standards. For <a href="/legal-translation-dubai/">legal proceedings</a>, additional notarization may be required.</p>
        
        <h4>For Schools and Universities</h4>
        <p>Most institutions accept our MOJ-certified translations directly. Some international schools may have additional requirements — check with the admissions office first.</p>
        
        <h4>For Banks and Financial Institutions</h4>
        <p>Banks typically accept our translations for account opening and loan applications. Some banks have specific format requirements which we accommodate.</p>
        
        <h3>Pricing Structure</h3>
        
        <p>Personal document translation pricing depends on document complexity and urgency:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Single-page certificates</strong> (birth, marriage, degree): Standard rate, 60-minute delivery available</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-page documents</strong> (transcripts, bank statements): Per-page pricing, same-day delivery</li>
          <li><strong>Document packages</strong> (Golden Visa, family sponsorship): Bundled pricing with 15% discount</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>See our <a href="/resources/pricing-guide/">detailed pricing guide</a> or send your documents for an instant quote.</p>
        
        <h3>Why Document Pre-Validation Matters</h3>
        
        <p>We do not simply translate what you send us. Before accepting payment, we verify:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Document legibility and completeness</li>
          <li>Presence of required attestation stamps</li>
          <li>Document validity period</li>
          <li>Consistency with your stated purpose</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This "White-Glove Shield" approach means we sometimes tell customers their document is not ready for translation. While this may seem unhelpful in the moment, it prevents wasted money and failed applications.</p>
        
        <p>If your document needs attestation first, we explain exactly how to get it — or handle the <a href="/services/attestation/">attestation process</a> for you.</p>
