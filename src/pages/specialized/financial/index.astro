      <h2>Common Uses for Financial Translation</h2>
      <div class="content-prose">
        <h3>Bank Account Opening</h3>
        <p>UAE banks conducting due diligence may request translated financial documents—bank statements from other institutions, proof of income source, or investment records. We provide certified translations that meet banking compliance requirements.</p>
        
        <h3>Visa and Immigration</h3>
        <p>Financial proof is essential for many visa categories. Investor visas, Golden Visas, and self-sponsorship applications require documentation of financial means. We translate the financial evidence supporting these applications.</p>
        
        <h3>Legal Proceedings</h3>
        <p>Court cases involving financial matters—contract disputes, fraud allegations, asset tracing—require translated financial evidence. Banks, courts, and lawyers need accurate translations of financial records for litigation support.</p>
        
        <h3>Company Formation and Licensing</h3>
        <p>Business setup may require financial documentation from existing businesses—audited accounts, bank references, or proof of capital. We translate these documents for free zone and mainland company registration.</p>
        
        <h3>Real Estate Transactions</h3>
        <p>Property purchases may require proof of funds or financing documentation. Banks and developers may request translated financial records to verify buyer qualifications.</p>

      <h2>Handling Numbers and Formats</h2>
      <div class="content-prose">
        <p>Financial documents are number-heavy, and accuracy is critical. We apply specific quality controls to ensure financial translations are correct.</p>
        
        <h3>Number Verification</h3>
        <p>Translations undergo number verification—checking that amounts, dates, and account numbers match the original exactly. A transposed digit or decimal error could cause serious problems in banking or legal contexts.</p>
        
        <h3>Currency and Format Conventions</h3>
        <p>Different countries use different number formats—decimal separators, thousand separators, and date formats vary. We maintain original values while formatting appropriately for Arabic readers, with clear indication of currencies throughout.</p>
        
        <h3>Table and Chart Translation</h3>
        <p>Financial documents often contain tables, charts, and graphs. We translate these maintaining their structure and readability, ensuring the translated document is as clear as the original.</p>
        
        <h3>Technical Accounting Terms</h3>
        <p>Financial documents use accounting terminology—assets, liabilities, equity, depreciation, accruals. Our translators understand accounting concepts and use correct Arabic equivalents that accountants and auditors expect.</p>
