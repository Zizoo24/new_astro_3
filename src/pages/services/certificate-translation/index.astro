const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What types of certificates do you translate?",
    answer: "We translate all certificate types required for UAE use: birth certificates, marriage certificates, death certificates, divorce decrees, academic degrees and diplomas, professional certifications, trade certificates, medical certificates, police clearance certificates, driving licenses, and any official document issued by government or institutional authorities. Each translation receives MOJ certification for UAE government acceptance."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does certificate translation take?",
    answer: "Standard single-page certificates (birth, marriage, degree) complete within 4-6 hours. Multi-page certificates or those with complex formatting take 24 hours. Academic transcripts with multiple pages take 24-48 hours depending on length. We offer express 2-hour service for urgent requirements. You receive exact timelines when we assess your specific documents."
  },
  {
    question: "Do certificates need attestation before translation?",
    answer: "It depends on the intended use. For most UAE government submissions (visa applications, employment, court proceedings), foreign certificates need attestation before translation. The attestation chain includes: notarization in the issuing country, foreign ministry authentication, UAE Embassy attestation, and MOFA legalization. We advise on requirements and can coordinate attestation services."
  },
  {
    question: "Are your certificate translations accepted by UAE immigration?",
    answer: "Yes. All our translations are performed by MOJ-certified translators and include the official stamp with QR verification code. GDRFA, ICA, and all UAE immigration authorities accept our translations for visa applications, family sponsorship, residency permits, and Golden Visa applications. We format translations to meet specific immigration submission requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the cost of certificate translation?",
    answer: "Standard single-page certificates (birth, marriage, degree) are AED 150 per page including MOJ certification. Multi-page documents receive volume pricing at AED 120 per page for 5+ pages. Express same-day service adds 50% to standard rates. We provide exact quotes after reviewing your documents—the quoted price is the final price with no hidden fees."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you translate certificates in languages other than English?",
    answer: "Yes. We translate certificates from 40+ languages into Arabic for UAE use, and from Arabic into English or other languages. Common source languages include Hindi, Urdu, Tagalog, Russian, French, German, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, Farsi, and Turkish. All translations receive the same MOJ certification regardless of source language."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my certificate has errors or unclear text?",
    answer: "We translate exactly what appears on your certificate, including any errors in the original. If text is unclear due to poor scan quality, stamps obscuring text, or document damage, we note this in the translation. For critical documents, we recommend obtaining a clearer copy or certified duplicate from the issuing authority before translation."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you translate certificates for school enrollment?",
    answer: "Yes. We translate all documents required for UAE school enrollment: birth certificates, previous school transcripts, transfer certificates, vaccination records, and parent identification documents. We understand KHDA requirements for Dubai schools and ADEK requirements for Abu Dhabi schools, formatting translations for direct submission to school administration."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I ensure name consistency across translated certificates?",
    answer: "Name consistency is critical—mismatches cause government rejections. We verify all translated names match your passport and Emirates ID exactly. Send copies of your ID documents with your certificates so we can ensure consistent spelling across all translations. For names with multiple transliteration variants, we use your passport spelling as the standard."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you translate old or historical certificates?",
    answer: "Yes. We translate certificates regardless of age, including historical documents, vintage birth certificates, and archived records. Older documents may require additional care due to faded text, archaic language, or unfamiliar formats. We note any legibility issues and translate all readable content with appropriate annotations where text is unclear."

        <div class="content-main">
          <h2>Why Certificate Translation Matters</h2>
          
          <p>A certificate proves identity, status, or qualifications. In the UAE, foreign certificates carry no weight without MOJ-certified translation.</p>
          
          <div class="impact-box">
            <p><strong>Without proper translation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Birth certificate cannot support family visa</li>
              <li>Degree cannot verify employment</li>
              <li>Marriage certificate has no legal standing</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          
          <p>Our translators work with certificates daily. They know precise requirements for each document type.</p>

          <h3>The Importance of Accuracy</h3>
          
          <p>Certificate translation demands absolute accuracy.</p>
          
          <ul class="accuracy-list">
            <li><strong>Misspelled name?</strong> Visa rejection.</li>
            <li><strong>Wrong date?</strong> Processing delays.</li>
            <li><strong>Missing stamp details?</strong> Authenticity questions.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>We capture every detail: stamps, signatures, marginal notations. The translation completely represents the original.</p>
          
          <div class="name-check-box">
            <h4><i class="fas fa-user-check"></i> Name Consistency Check</h4>
            <p>We verify translated names match your passport and Emirates ID exactly. This check has prevented countless rejections.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Understanding Attestation Requirements</h3>
          
          <p>Many UAE uses require attestation before translation. Attestation authenticates your document through government authorities.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Typical requirements:</strong></p>
          <ul class="attest-reqs">
            <li>Birth certificates for visas → Full attestation needed</li>
            <li>Marriage certificates for sponsorship → Full attestation needed</li>
            <li>Degree certificates for employment → Attestation + MOHESR verification</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>We advise on requirements during initial assessment. We can coordinate attestation if needed.</p>

          <h3>Formatting for Specific Uses</h3>
          
          <p>Different authorities have different expectations:</p>
          
          <ul class="format-list">
            <li><strong>Immigration:</strong> Specific layout for visa submissions</li>
            <li><strong>Schools:</strong> KHDA/ADEK formatting requirements</li>
            <li><strong>Courts:</strong> Evidentiary submission standards</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>We format each translation for its destination. Smooth acceptance, no revisions needed.</p>
