  {
    question: 'What is an apostille?',
    answer: 'An apostille is a simplified form of document authentication used between countries that are members of the Hague Apostille Convention. Instead of the lengthy embassy legalization chain, a single apostille certificate from the issuing country makes the document valid in all other member countries. The apostille confirms the document signature and seal are genuine.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is the UAE a member of the Hague Apostille Convention?',
    answer: 'No. The UAE is not currently a member of the Hague Apostille Convention. This means documents from Hague-member countries (US, UK, India, Australia, etc.) may be apostilled in the issuing country, but still require UAE Embassy attestation and MOFA attestation for UAE use. The apostille simplifies authentication in the origin country but does not eliminate the UAE legalisation chain.'
  },
  {
    question: 'When should I use apostille vs traditional attestation?',
    answer: 'Use apostille when both the issuing country AND destination country are Hague Convention members. Since the UAE is not a Hague member, documents from Hague countries still require the full chain: apostille in origin country, UAE Embassy attestation, then MOFA attestation in UAE. The apostille simplifies the first step but does not eliminate embassy requirements for UAE use. We advise on the correct route for your specific situation.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Which documents can be apostilled?',
    answer: 'Most public documents can be apostilled: birth certificates, marriage certificates, educational credentials, court documents, notarized documents, and government-issued certificates. Private documents (like commercial contracts) typically need notarization first, then the notarized document can be apostilled.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does apostille take?',
    answer: 'Processing time varies by country. US apostilles typically take 3-5 business days (longer for federal documents). UK apostilles take 2-5 days through FCDO. Australian apostilles take 5-10 days through DFAT. We provide realistic timelines based on current processing speeds in each country.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do apostilled documents need translation?',
    answer: 'For UAE use, yes. While the apostille authenticates the document, UAE government entities and courts require Arabic translation. The translation should be done after apostille so it reflects the authenticated document. We coordinate both apostille and subsequent MOJ-certified translation.'

      <h2>Understanding Apostille for UAE-Bound Documents</h2>
      <p>The UAE is not currently a member of the Hague Apostille Convention. This means documents destined for UAE use require authentication through the traditional legalisation chain, regardless of whether your document's country of origin is a Hague member.</p>

      <p>For documents from Hague-member countries (US, UK, India, Australia, Canada, etc.), the process is: (1) Obtain apostille in the issuing country, (2) UAE Embassy attestation in the issuing country, (3) MOFA/MOFAIC attestation in UAE, and (4) Translation if required.</p>

      <p>For documents from non-Hague countries (Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, etc.), the full embassy attestation chain is required: notarisation, home country Ministry of Foreign Affairs, UAE Embassy, then MOFA in UAE.</p>

      <p>While an apostille from a Hague-member country simplifies the first step of authentication, it does not eliminate the need for UAE Embassy and MOFA attestation.</p>
