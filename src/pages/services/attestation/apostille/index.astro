const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What is an apostille?',
    answer: 'An apostille is a simplified form of document authentication used between countries that are members of the Hague Apostille Convention. Instead of the lengthy embassy legalization chain, a single apostille certificate from the issuing country makes the document valid in all other member countries. The apostille confirms the document signature and seal are genuine.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is the UAE a member of the Hague Apostille Convention?',
    answer: 'Yes. The UAE joined the Hague Apostille Convention in 2023, which significantly simplifies document authentication. Documents apostilled in UAE are now accepted in 120+ member countries without additional embassy legalization. Similarly, apostilled documents from other member countries are accepted in UAE with just MOFA attestation.'
  },
  {
    question: 'When should I use apostille vs traditional attestation?',
    answer: 'Use apostille when both the issuing country AND destination country are Hague Convention members. If either country is not a member, traditional embassy attestation is required. For UAE use, apostilled foreign documents still need MOFA attestation as the final step. We advise on the correct route for your specific situation.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Which documents can be apostilled?',
    answer: 'Most public documents can be apostilled: birth certificates, marriage certificates, educational credentials, court documents, notarized documents, and government-issued certificates. Private documents (like commercial contracts) typically need notarization first, then the notarized document can be apostilled.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does apostille take?',
    answer: 'Processing time varies by country. US apostilles typically take 3-5 business days (longer for federal documents). UK apostilles take 2-5 days through FCDO. Australian apostilles take 5-10 days through DFAT. We provide realistic timelines based on current processing speeds in each country.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do apostilled documents need translation?',
    answer: 'For UAE use, yes. While the apostille authenticates the document, UAE government entities and courts require Arabic translation. The translation should be done after apostille so it reflects the authenticated document. We coordinate both apostille and subsequent MOJ-certified translation.'

      <h2>The UAE and the Hague Apostille Convention</h2>
      <p>The UAE's accession to the Hague Apostille Convention in 2023 marked a significant change in document authentication. Previously, all foreign documents required the lengthy embassy attestation chain. Now, documents from other member countries can follow the simplified apostille route.</p>
      
      <p>For documents destined for UAE use, apostilled documents from member countries require only MOFA attestation as the final step—eliminating the need for UAE Embassy attestation in the origin country. This saves time, reduces costs, and simplifies the process considerably.</p>
      
      <p>Similarly, UAE-issued documents can now be apostilled for use in other member countries, replacing the previous requirement for embassy legalization at each destination country's embassy.</p>
