  {
    question: 'Does Canada accept apostille now?',
    answer: 'Yes. Canada joined the Hague Apostille Convention on January 11, 2024, becoming the 125th member country. This is a significant change from the old multi-step authentication process. Canadian documents can now receive a single apostille from provincial or federal authorities, replacing the previous provincial authentication plus Global Affairs Canada legalization. However, for UAE use, embassy attestation is still required because UAE is not a Hague member.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Where do I get a Canadian apostille?',
    answer: 'It depends on your document type and issuing province. Provincial documents (birth/marriage/death certificates, educational credentials from provincial institutions) are apostilled by the provincial government. Federal documents (RCMP police clearance, federal court orders, documents from federal agencies) are apostilled by Global Affairs Canada (GAC) in Ottawa. We advise on the correct authority for your specific document.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I still need UAE Embassy attestation after the apostille?',
    answer: 'Yes. Because the UAE is NOT a member of the Hague Convention, UAE Embassy attestation is still required after the Canadian apostille. The apostille simplifies the Canadian authentication step, but does not eliminate UAE requirements. Your document needs: Canadian apostille → UAE Embassy Ottawa → MOFA UAE. Do not skip embassy attestation thinking the apostille alone is sufficient.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What about documents issued before January 2024?',
    answer: 'Documents issued before January 2024 can still receive an apostille. The apostille confirms the document is genuine as of the date it was issued. There is no requirement that the document was issued after Canada joined the Hague Convention. Old degrees, birth certificates, and other documents qualify for apostille regardless of their original issue date.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does the full Canadian attestation process take?',
    answer: 'Canadian apostille takes 5-10 business days depending on the issuing authority (provincial or GAC). UAE Embassy attestation in Ottawa takes 3-5 business days. MOFA UAE takes 1-3 business days. Total time is typically 10-14 business days for the complete chain. Rush services are available at some steps for urgent requirements.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you coordinate the UAE steps for me?',
    answer: 'Yes. Once your document has a Canadian apostille, we coordinate UAE Embassy attestation, MOFA attestation, and Arabic translation. You can send the apostilled document to us in Dubai, or our partners can handle the Ottawa embassy step before forwarding to UAE. We manage the complete chain so you receive fully attested documents ready for submission.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need translation for MOFA attestation?',
    answer: 'MOFA does not require translation for attestation—they attest the original document regardless of language. However, the UAE authority you are ultimately submitting to (immigration, court, employer, licensing body) typically requires Arabic translation by an MOJ-certified translator. We provide translation after attestation is complete so all stamps are properly referenced.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is different from the old Canadian authentication process?',
    answer: 'Before January 2024, Canadian documents required a longer authentication chain: provincial authentication → Global Affairs Canada legalization → UAE Embassy → MOFA. The apostille now replaces the first two steps with a single apostille certificate. This saves time, reduces costs, and simplifies the process while maintaining document validity.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if my document is in French?',
    answer: 'Quebec documents and some federal documents are issued in French. This does not affect the apostille process, but you will need Arabic translation for UAE submission. We translate French documents to Arabic directly, or can provide English and Arabic translations if needed for your purposes.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I get an RCMP police clearance for UAE?',
    answer: 'You request your RCMP Criminal Record Check through the RCMP Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC). Once received, it is apostilled by Global Affairs Canada (as a federal document), then UAE Embassy and MOFA attestation. RCMP checks are valid for limited periods, so timing matters. We coordinate the attestation to ensure your check remains valid through submission.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I attest a certified copy of my Canadian document?',
    answer: 'For some documents, certified copies can be apostilled. The copy must be certified by an authorized official (notary, commissioner of oaths, or issuing authority). Birth certificate copies from provincial vital statistics offices are typically acceptable. For degrees, contact your university about issuing additional official copies. We advise on what is acceptable for your specific document and purpose.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I live outside Canada?',
    answer: 'You can manage the attestation remotely. Our partners in Canada coordinate provincial or GAC apostille, UAE Embassy Ottawa attestation, and courier to Dubai for MOFA completion. You do not need to be present in Canada. The document can be mailed to Canada for processing, then couriered to Dubai for final steps.'

This simplifies the Canadian steps but does not eliminate UAE Embassy and MOFA attestation requirements because UAE is not a Hague member country.</p>

<h3>The Canadian Attestation Chain (2024)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Provincial or Federal Apostille</strong> — Single-step Canadian authentication (replaces old multi-step process)</li>
<li><strong>UAE Embassy Ottawa</strong> — Embassy legalization (still required because UAE is not in Hague Convention)</li>
<li><strong>MOFA UAE</strong> — Final attestation for UAE government acceptance</li>
</ul>

<h3>Critical: UAE Is Not a Hague Member</h3>
<p>A Canadian apostille alone is NOT sufficient for UAE use. You still need UAE Embassy attestation and MOFA after the apostille. Do not skip these steps.</p>

<h3>Provincial vs Federal Documents</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Provincial apostille</strong> — <a href="/personal/vital-records/birth/">Birth</a>, <a href="/personal/vital-records/marriage/">marriage</a>, <a href="/personal/vital-records/death/">death</a> certificates, <a href="/personal/academic/degree/">university degrees</a> (Ontario, BC, Quebec, Alberta, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Federal apostille (GAC)</strong> — RCMP <a href="/personal/immigration/pcc/">police clearance</a>, federal court orders, Immigration documents</li>
</ul>

<h3>Documents We Attest</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Educational</strong> — <a href="/personal/academic/degree/">Degrees</a> from U of T, McGill, UBC, <a href="/personal/academic/transcripts/">transcripts</a>, professional certifications (CPA, P.Eng)</li>

      <h2>Understanding Canada's New Apostille System</h2>
      
      <p>Canada's joining of the Hague Apostille Convention in January 2024 marked a significant change in how Canadian documents are authenticated for international use. Previously, Canadian documents required a lengthy chain of provincial authentication followed by Global Affairs Canada legalization. Now, a single apostille certificate replaces these steps, making the process faster and more straightforward.</p>

      <InlineCallout
        type="info"
        title="New 2024 Apostille System"
        text="Since January 11, 2024, Canadian documents receive a single apostille from provincial or federal authorities. This replaces the old multi-step authentication process. However, for UAE use, embassy attestation is still required after the apostille because UAE is not a Hague Convention member."
      />

      <h3>Why UAE Still Requires Embassy Attestation</h3>
      
      <p>The Hague Apostille Convention is an agreement between member countries to accept each other's apostilled documents without further legalization. However, the UAE is not a member of this convention. This means that while the Canadian apostille is valid proof of document authenticity, it is not automatically recognized by UAE authorities.</p>
      
      <p>For documents intended for use in UAE, you need the complete chain: Canadian apostille, then UAE Embassy attestation in Ottawa (or Vancouver/Toronto consulates), then MOFA attestation in UAE. Skipping the embassy step will result in your documents being rejected by UAE authorities.</p>

      <h3>Provincial vs Federal Documents</h3>
      
      <p>Canada's federal system means documents originate from different levels of government. Understanding which authority apostilles your document is the first step:</p>
      
      <ul style="margin: 1.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
        <li><strong>Provincial documents</strong> (most common): Birth certificates, marriage certificates, death certificates, and educational credentials from provincial institutions are apostilled by the respective provincial government. An Ontario degree goes to Ontario, a BC birth certificate goes to BC.</li>
        <li><strong>Federal documents</strong>: RCMP police clearances, federal court orders, and documents from federal agencies (like IRCC) are apostilled by Global Affairs Canada in Ottawa.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Benefits of the New System</h3>
      
      <p>The apostille system offers several advantages over the previous process:</p>
      
      <ul style="margin: 1.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
        <li>Faster processing: One step instead of provincial authentication plus GAC legalization</li>
        <li>Lower costs: Fewer government fees and handling steps</li>
        <li>Simpler documentation: Single apostille certificate instead of multiple stamps</li>
        <li>Clearer validity: Standardized international format recognized worldwide</li>
      </ul>
