const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'Does Canada accept apostille now?',
    answer: 'Yes. Canada joined the Hague Apostille Convention on January 11, 2024. This is a significant change from the old process. Canadian documents can now receive an apostille from provincial or federal authorities, simplifying the first steps of international authentication. However, for UAE use, embassy attestation is still required.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Where do I get a Canadian apostille?',
    answer: 'It depends on your document type. Provincial documents (birth/marriage certificates, educational credentials) are apostilled by the provincial government. Federal documents (RCMP police clearance, federal court orders) are apostilled by Global Affairs Canada (GAC). We advise on the correct authority for your specific document.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I still need UAE Embassy attestation?',
    answer: 'Yes. Because the UAE is NOT a member of the Hague Convention, UAE Embassy attestation is still required after the Canadian apostille. The apostille simplifies the Canadian authentication step, but does not eliminate UAE requirements. Your document needs: Canadian apostille → UAE Embassy → MOFA UAE.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What about documents issued before 2024?',
    answer: 'Documents issued before January 2024 can still receive an apostille. The apostille confirms the document is genuine as of the date it was issued. There is no requirement that the document was issued after Canada joined the Hague Convention.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does the full process take?',
    answer: 'Canadian apostille takes 5-10 business days depending on the issuing authority. UAE Embassy attestation in Ottawa takes 3-5 business days. MOFA UAE takes 1-3 business days. Total time is typically 10-14 business days. Rush services are available at some steps.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you coordinate the UAE steps for me?',
    answer: 'Yes. Once your document has a Canadian apostille, we coordinate UAE Embassy attestation, MOFA attestation, and translation. You can send the apostilled document to us in Dubai, or our partners can handle the Ottawa embassy step before forwarding to UAE.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need translation for MOFA?',
    answer: 'MOFA does not require translation for attestation—they attest the original document. However, the UAE authority you are ultimately submitting to (immigration, court, employer) typically requires Arabic translation. We provide MOJ-certified translation after attestation is complete.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is different from the old process?',
    answer: 'Before January 2024, Canadian documents required a longer authentication chain: provincial authentication → Global Affairs Canada → UAE Embassy → MOFA. The apostille now replaces the first two steps with a single apostille certificate. This saves time and simplifies the process.'
