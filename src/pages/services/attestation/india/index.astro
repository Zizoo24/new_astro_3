const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What is the attestation chain for Indian documents?',
    answer: 'Indian documents typically require: (1) Notary attestation, (2) State Home Department or SDM, (3) HRD for educational documents in some states, (4) MEA apostille/attestation, (5) UAE Embassy legalization, and (6) MOFA attestation in UAE. The exact chain depends on document type and issuing state.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Which Indian documents need attestation for UAE?',
    answer: 'Common documents requiring attestation include educational certificates (degrees, diplomas, mark sheets), personal documents (birth certificates, marriage certificates, police clearance), and commercial documents (company registration, board resolutions, power of attorney). Employment visas typically require attested educational certificates, while family visas require attested personal documents.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is MEA attestation?',
    answer: 'MEA stands for Ministry of External Affairs, the Indian government department responsible for foreign affairs. MEA attestation confirms that the document has been properly authenticated within India and is genuine for use abroad. MEA operates attestation centers in Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata, and other major cities. This step comes after state-level attestation and before UAE Embassy legalization.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is HRD attestation required for educational certificates?',
    answer: 'Some states require Human Resource Development (HRD) attestation for educational certificates before MEA attestation. This adds verification at the state education department level. States like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra have specific HRD requirements. We confirm the exact requirements based on your certificate issuing state.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does Indian document attestation take?',
    answer: 'Standard processing takes 5-7 working days for the complete chain from India to UAE MOFA. Express service is available for urgent requirements. Processing time varies by state - some states process faster than others. We provide accurate timelines based on your specific document and issuing state.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the cost of Indian document attestation?',
    answer: 'Costs include government fees at each attestation level plus our service coordination fee. Government fees vary by document type and state. We provide a complete cost breakdown before you proceed, with no hidden charges. Our fee covers coordination, tracking, and communication throughout the process.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate and attest documents together?',
    answer: 'Yes. For documents requiring both attestation and translation, the sequence matters. Generally, you attest the original document first through the full chain, then we translate the attested document into Arabic with MOJ certification. Some clients need only attestation (the document is already bilingual), while others need both services. We advise on the correct approach for your specific use case.'

  heroIntro={`<p>Complete attestation service for Indian documents required in UAE. We handle the full chain: state-level HRD/Home Department, MEA apostille, UAE Embassy attestation, and MOFA. Documents from all Indian states processed efficiently.</p>

<h3>The Indian Attestation Chain</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Notary</strong> — Initial verification of document authenticity</li>
<li><strong>State Home Dept/SDM</strong> — State-level authentication</li>
<li><strong>HRD (educational only)</strong> — Required by some states for degrees</li>
<li><strong>MEA Apostille</strong> — Ministry of External Affairs central authentication</li>
<li><strong>UAE Embassy</strong> — Delhi, Mumbai, or regional consulate</li>
<li><strong>MOFA UAE</strong> — Final attestation for UAE government acceptance</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hague Convention Status</h3>
<p>India joined the <a href="/services/attestation/apostille/">Hague Apostille Convention</a> in July 2005. However, since UAE is not a Hague member, Indian documents still require UAE Embassy attestation and MOFA—apostille alone is not sufficient.</p>

<h3>Documents We Attest</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Educational</strong> — <a href="/personal/academic/degree/">Degrees</a>, diplomas, <a href="/personal/academic/transcripts/">transcripts</a> from any UGC-recognized institution</li>
<li><strong>Personal</strong> — <a href="/personal/vital-records/birth/">Birth</a>, <a href="/personal/vital-records/marriage/">marriage</a>, <a href="/personal/vital-records/death/">death</a> certificates, <a href="/personal/immigration/pcc/">PCC</a></li>
<li><strong>Commercial</strong> — <a href="/legal/corporate/moa/">Company registration</a>, <a href="/legal/corporate/poa/">POA</a>, board resolutions</li>
</ul>

<h3>State-Specific Requirements</h3>
<p>Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka require HRD attestation before MEA for educational certificates. Other states go directly to MEA after Home Department. We know exact requirements for each state.</p>

<h3>Turnaround</h3>
<p>Standard: <strong>5-7 working days</strong> for complete chain. Express service available. Established agent networks across India ensure efficient processing.</p>`}
