  {
    question: 'What is the attestation process for US documents?',
    answer: 'US documents follow a 5-step chain. Notarization if needed, then Secretary of State authentication. Next is Department of State apostille, followed by UAE Embassy DC. Finally, MOFA attestation in UAE completes the process.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why do US documents need state-level authentication?',
    answer: 'The US federal system means most documents are issued by state authorities. Educational certificates come from state-licensed institutions, vital records from state registries. The Secretary of State authenticates that state-level officials are legitimate before federal authentication can proceed.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does US document attestation take?',
    answer: 'Processing varies significantly by state. Some states (Texas, Florida) process in 1-3 days, while others (California) take 2-4 weeks. Department of State adds 4-8 weeks standard or 1-2 weeks expedited. UAE Embassy and MOFA add 5-7 days. Total time ranges from 2-8 weeks depending on state and service level.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is FBI background check attestation different?',
    answer: 'Yes. FBI checks are federal documents, so they skip state authentication and go directly to Department of State for apostille. However, FBI reports have validity periods (typically 6 months), so timing is critical. We coordinate the process to ensure your FBI check remains valid throughout attestation.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Which states have the fastest processing?',
    answer: 'Texas (1-3 days), Florida (1-2 days), and New York (same-day in-person) are among the fastest. California is one of the slowest at 2-4 weeks with mail-only processing. We factor state processing times into your timeline estimate.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to be in the US for attestation?',
    answer: 'No. You can send your documents to us or our US partners. We coordinate Secretary of State, Department of State, UAE Embassy DC, and arrange secure courier to Dubai for MOFA completion. The entire process can be managed remotely.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What about documents from US territories?',
    answer: 'Documents from Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, Guam, and other territories follow similar processes but may have different authentication offices. We handle documents from all US territories.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is translation required after attestation?',
    answer: 'Yes, for most UAE government submissions. US documents are in English, but UAE authorities typically require Arabic translation by an MOJ-certified translator. We provide combined attestation and translation services.'

      <h2>Understanding US Document Attestation</h2>
      
      <p>The United States presents unique challenges for document attestation due to its federal system. Unlike countries with centralized government document issuance, most US documents originate from state authorities rather than the federal government. This means your California degree, Texas birth certificate, or Florida marriage certificate each requires authentication from different state offices before federal authentication can proceed.</p>

      <h3>The State-Federal Authentication Chain</h3>
      
      <p>Most US documents follow this path: First, the document may need notarization if not already issued by a government office. Second, the Secretary of State (or equivalent) in the issuing state authenticates the notary or official signature. Third, the US Department of State in Washington DC applies the federal apostille. Only then can UAE Embassy and MOFA attestation proceed.</p>
      
      <p>Each of the 50 states has different procedures, offices, and processing times. Some states offer same-day in-person service while others require weeks of mail-in processing. This variation significantly impacts total attestation timeline and requires familiarity with each state's system.</p>

      <h3>Department of State Processing</h3>
      
      <p>After state authentication, documents go to the US Department of State Office of Authentications. Standard processing currently takes 4-8 weeks due to high volumes. Expedited service reduces this to 1-2 weeks for additional fees. This federal step is often the longest part of US document attestation, so planning ahead is essential.</p>

      <h3>Federal Documents</h3>
      
      <p>Some documents originate from federal agencies rather than state authorities. FBI background checks are the most common example for UAE visa applications. These federal documents skip state authentication and go directly to Department of State for apostille. However, FBI reports have validity periods, so timing coordination is critical.</p>
