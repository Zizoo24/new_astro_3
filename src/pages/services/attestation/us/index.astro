const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What is the attestation process for US documents?',
    answer: 'US documents follow a 5-step chain. Notarization if needed, then Secretary of State authentication in the issuing state. Next is Department of State apostille in Washington DC, followed by UAE Embassy DC legalization. Finally, MOFA attestation in UAE completes the process. The entire chain typically takes 2-8 weeks depending on state processing times and service level selected.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why do US documents need state-level authentication?',
    answer: 'The US federal system means most documents are issued by state authorities rather than the federal government. Educational certificates come from state-licensed institutions, vital records from state registries, and corporate documents from state business registries. The Secretary of State authenticates that state-level officials are legitimate before federal authentication can proceed. This dual-level system is unique to the United States.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does US document attestation take?',
    answer: 'Processing varies significantly by state. Fast states like Texas process in 1-3 days, Florida in 1-2 days, and New York offers same-day in-person service. Slow states like California take 2-4 weeks with mail-only processing. The Department of State adds 4-8 weeks standard or 1-2 weeks expedited. UAE Embassy and MOFA add 5-7 days. Total time ranges from 2-8 weeks depending on state and service level.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is FBI background check attestation different?',
    answer: 'Yes. FBI Identity History Summary checks are federal documents, so they skip state authentication entirely and go directly to Department of State for apostille. However, FBI reports have validity periods (typically 6 months from issue), so timing is critical. We coordinate the process to ensure your FBI check remains valid throughout attestation and submission to UAE authorities.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Which states have the fastest processing?',
    answer: 'Texas (1-3 days), Florida (1-2 days), and New York (same-day in-person at Albany or NYC) are among the fastest for Secretary of State processing. Illinois and Pennsylvania also offer relatively quick turnaround. California is one of the slowest at 2-4 weeks with mail-only processing and no walk-in options. We factor state processing times into your timeline estimate.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to be in the US for attestation?',
    answer: 'No. You can send your documents to us or our US partners from anywhere in the world. We coordinate Secretary of State authentication, Department of State apostille, UAE Embassy DC legalization, and arrange secure courier to Dubai for MOFA completion. The entire process can be managed remotely without requiring your presence in the United States.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What about documents from US territories?',
    answer: 'Documents from Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and Northern Mariana Islands follow similar processes but may have different authentication offices. Puerto Rico has its own Secretary of State, while other territories have territorial equivalents. We handle documents from all US territories with knowledge of their specific procedures.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is translation required after attestation?',
    answer: 'Yes, for most UAE government submissions. US documents are in English, but UAE authorities typically require Arabic translation by an MOJ-certified translator. We provide combined attestation and translation services, completing the translation after attestation so all stamps and seals are referenced in the Arabic version.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between Secretary of State and Department of State?',
    answer: 'Each US state has a Secretary of State who handles state-level document authentication. This is different from the US Department of State (federal), which handles apostilles and international authentication. State documents must first be authenticated by the state Secretary of State, then sent to the federal Department of State for apostille before UAE Embassy processing.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I attest a photocopy of my US document?',
    answer: 'Generally, no. UAE authorities require attestation of original documents. However, for certain documents like transcripts or degrees where you need to retain the original, a certified copy can sometimes be attested. The copy must be notarized as a true copy by a US notary, then proceed through the standard authentication chain. We advise on the best approach for your specific situation.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if my document is from a state I no longer live in?',
    answer: 'The document must be authenticated in the state that issued it, regardless of where you currently reside. A California degree must go through California Secretary of State even if you now live in Texas. We coordinate with offices in all 50 states, so your current location does not affect our ability to process your document.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I know if my US university is recognized for UAE purposes?',
    answer: 'Your university should be accredited by a regional accreditation body recognized by the US Department of Education. For healthcare professionals, additional verification through DataFlow or similar services may be required. We can advise on whether your specific institution credentials will be accepted for your intended UAE purpose.'

      <h2>Understanding US Document Attestation</h2>
      
      <p>The United States presents unique challenges for document attestation due to its federal system. Unlike countries with centralized government document issuance, most US documents originate from state authorities rather than the federal government. This means your California degree, Texas birth certificate, or Florida marriage certificate each requires authentication from different state offices before federal authentication can proceed.</p>

      <InlineCallout
        type="info"
        title="US Federal System"
        text="The US has 50 states, each with its own Secretary of State office that handles document authentication. Documents must be authenticated in the state where they were issued, regardless of where you currently live."
      />

      <h3>The State-Federal Authentication Chain</h3>
      
      <p>Most US documents follow this path: First, the document may need notarization if not already issued by a government office. Second, the Secretary of State (or equivalent) in the issuing state authenticates the notary or official signature. Third, the US Department of State in Washington DC applies the federal apostille. Only then can UAE Embassy and MOFA attestation proceed.</p>
      
      <p>Each of the 50 states has different procedures, offices, and processing times. Some states offer same-day in-person service while others require weeks of mail-in processing. This variation significantly impacts total attestation timeline and requires familiarity with each state's system. Our experience with all 50 states allows us to provide accurate timelines and avoid common pitfalls.</p>

      <h3>Department of State Processing</h3>
      
      <p>After state authentication, documents go to the US Department of State Office of Authentications in Washington DC. This is the federal government office responsible for issuing apostilles—internationally recognized certificates confirming US government authentication. Standard processing currently takes 4-8 weeks due to high volumes and staffing constraints. Expedited service is available for 1-2 weeks at additional cost, which we recommend for time-sensitive applications.</p>

      <p>The Department of State is often the bottleneck in US document attestation. While some states process in 1-2 days, the federal step adds weeks to the timeline. Planning ahead is essential, especially for employment visa deadlines or family visa sponsorship timelines.</p>

      <h3>Federal Documents: FBI Background Check</h3>
      
      <p>Some documents originate from federal agencies rather than state authorities. The FBI Identity History Summary (criminal background check) is the most common example for UAE visa applications, <a href="/services/golden-visa-translation/">Golden Visa</a>, and employment verification. These federal documents skip state authentication entirely and go directly to Department of State for apostille.</p>
      
      <p>However, FBI reports have validity periods of typically 6 months from issue date. This creates timing challenges—you need the attestation completed and document submitted to UAE authorities before expiration. We coordinate the process to ensure your FBI check remains valid throughout attestation and final submission.</p>

      <h3>UAE is Not a Hague Convention Member</h3>
      
      <p>The United States is a member of the <a href="/services/attestation/apostille/">Hague Apostille Convention</a>, which simplifies document authentication between member countries. However, because the UAE is NOT a Hague member, US documents require additional steps after the apostille. The UAE Embassy legalization and MOFA attestation are still required—the apostille alone is not sufficient for UAE use.</p>
