  {
    question: "What documents can you translate?",
    answer: "We translate all documents for UAE government, court, and business use. Personal documents include birth, marriage, divorce, and death certificates. Academic documents cover degrees, transcripts, and school records. We also handle police clearance, bank statements, driving licenses, contracts, court judgments, powers of attorney, trade licenses, and corporate filings. Have something else? Send it via WhatsApp for a free assessment."
  },
  {
    question: "Are your translations accepted by UAE courts and government?",
    answer: "Yes. Our MOJ-certified translators are registered with the UAE Ministry of Justice. Each translation includes the official MOJ stamp, translator signature, serial number, and QR code. This certification is accepted by Dubai Courts, Abu Dhabi Judicial Department, DIFC Courts, ADGM Courts, GDRFA, ICA, MOHRE, DLD, and all UAE government entities."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does translation take?",
    answer: "Single-page documents (birth certificates, marriage certificates) complete in 4-6 hours. Multi-page documents (contracts, transcripts) take 24-48 hours. Complex legal documents may need 2-3 business days. Need it faster? We offer same-day express service. Contact us with your deadline and we will confirm availability."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide attestation services?",
    answer: "Yes. We handle the complete attestation chain: notarization in your home country, Foreign Ministry authentication, UAE Embassy attestation, and final MOFA stamp in the UAE. We track your documents at every step. Timelines vary by country—typically 2-4 weeks for the full chain."
  },
  {
    question: "What languages do you translate?",
    answer: "We translate 43+ languages. These include Arabic, English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Hindi, Urdu, Tagalog, Bengali, Tamil, Malayalam, Farsi, and Turkish. Arabic-English is our most common pair for UAE use. All languages receive MOJ certification."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I send my documents for translation?",
    answer: "WhatsApp is the easiest way. Take clear photos or scan your documents. Send them to +971 50 862 0217. We also accept email and secure uploads. Supported formats: PDF, JPG, PNG, DOCX. Within 5-10 minutes, you get confirmation, requirements assessment, and a fixed quote."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the cost of translation services?",
    answer: "Standard certificates start at AED 150 per page with MOJ certification. Multi-page documents (5+ pages) get volume pricing at AED 120 per page. Complex legal documents are quoted based on length. Express same-day service adds 50%. We provide exact quotes after reviewing your documents. The quoted price is final—no hidden fees."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you deliver physical copies?",
    answer: "Yes. You receive digital copies immediately via WhatsApp and email. We also courier hard copies with original MOJ stamps anywhere in the UAE. Same-day delivery is available in Dubai. Abu Dhabi and Sharjah typically arrive next business day. International courier is available too."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with Golden Visa document requirements?",
    answer: "Yes. We provide complete packages for Golden Visa applications. This includes degree certificates, professional licenses, bank statements, salary certificates, and property title deeds. We format everything for ICA requirements. We also coordinate MOHESR attestation for academic credentials."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my translation is rejected by a government entity?",
    answer: "If any UAE entity rejects our translation due to our error, we fix it free of charge. We also cover courier costs for redelivery. This guarantee reflects our confidence in our process. We handle thousands of documents monthly with consistent acceptance."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between MOJ Legal Translation and Certified Translation?",
    answer: "MOJ Legal Translation (AED 1,400) is required for documents going to UAE courts, government ministries, and official proceedings. It includes the official MOJ stamp. Certified Translation (AED 700) is sufficient for private sector use—banks, HR departments, and corporate purposes. We help you choose the right option to avoid overpaying."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer on-site or doorstep services?",
    answer: "Yes. We offer document collection and delivery across Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and the Northern Emirates. Same-day collection available in most Dubai areas. Corporate clients can arrange scheduled pickups for ongoing translation needs."
