  {
    question: "What documents need translation for UAE Golden Visa?",
    answer: "Golden Visa applications require MOJ-certified translation of several documents: educational certificates (degrees, diplomas) with MOHESR attestation, professional licenses and certifications, bank statements showing required financial thresholds, salary certificates or income proof, property title deeds for real estate investors, company documents for business owners (MOA, trade license, audited financials), passport copies, and Emirates ID. The specific requirements depend on your Golden Visa category—investor, professional, or specialized talent."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need attestation in addition to translation for Golden Visa?",
    answer: "Yes, most Golden Visa documents require both attestation and translation. Educational certificates need MOHESR attestation (which includes UAE Embassy and MOFA attestation from the issuing country). Professional licenses may need attestation from relevant UAE authorities. We coordinate both services—attestation first, then MOJ-certified translation—ensuring proper sequencing for ICA acceptance."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the Golden Visa categories and their document requirements?",
    answer: "The main categories are: (1) Investors—property title deeds worth AED 2M+, or business ownership documents with audited financials; (2) Professionals—degree certificates, employment contracts, salary certificates showing AED 30,000+ monthly; (3) Specialized Talents—professional achievements, awards, publications, or recognition letters; (4) Entrepreneurs—business plans, startup documentation, incubator acceptance letters. Each category has specific document requirements we help you compile."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does Golden Visa document translation take?",
    answer: "A complete Golden Visa translation package typically takes 2-3 business days. Individual documents complete faster: degree certificates 24 hours, bank statements 24-48 hours depending on page count, property documents 24 hours. If your documents also need attestation, add 2-4 weeks for the attestation chain. We recommend starting the process 4-6 weeks before your intended application date."
  },
  {
    question: "What is MOHESR attestation and do I need it?",
    answer: "MOHESR (Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research) attestation verifies that your foreign degree is recognized in the UAE. It is mandatory for Golden Visa applications in the professional category. The process involves: attestation from your home country, UAE Embassy attestation, MOFA attestation, and finally MOHESR equivalency. We coordinate the complete chain and provide MOJ-certified translation of the attested certificate."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help if my degree is from an unrecognized university?",
    answer: "Some universities are not on the MOHESR recognized list, which can complicate Golden Visa applications. We can advise on alternative pathways: some applicants qualify through the investor route instead, others through specialized talent categories that focus on professional achievements rather than academic credentials. We assess your situation and recommend the most viable approach."
  },
  {
    question: "What bank statement requirements apply for Golden Visa?",
    answer: "Bank statements must demonstrate financial stability appropriate to your category. Professionals need statements showing consistent salary deposits of AED 30,000+ monthly. Investors need proof of investment funds or property ownership. Statements should cover 6 months minimum, show the account holder name matching your passport, and be translated with MOJ certification. We format translations to meet ICA review requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide document review before I apply?",
    answer: "Yes. We review your complete document package before translation to identify any gaps, missing documents, or potential issues that could delay your application. This pre-assessment catches problems like name mismatches between documents, missing attestations, insufficient financial proof, or documents that do not meet category requirements. Better to address these before paying for translation and application fees."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the cost of Golden Visa translation package?",
    answer: "Package pricing depends on your category and document count. A typical professional category package (degree, employment contract, salary certificate, bank statements, passport) runs AED 800-1,200. Investor packages with property documents and financial statements run AED 1,000-1,500. We provide detailed quotes after reviewing your specific documents. Package pricing saves 15-20% compared to individual document rates."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with Golden Visa renewals?",
    answer: "Yes. Golden Visa renewals require updated documentation proving you still meet category requirements. This includes recent bank statements, current employment verification, updated property valuations, or continued business activity proof. We translate renewal documents with the same MOJ certification and can advise on what documentation ICA typically requests for renewal applications."

          <h2>Why Golden Visa Applications Get Rejected</h2>
          
          <p>Golden Visa applications fail for preventable reasons: missing attestations, inconsistent name spellings across documents, translations without proper MOJ certification, financial documents that do not clearly demonstrate category requirements, or degrees from universities not on the MOHESR recognized list. Each rejection means delays, resubmission fees, and frustration.</p>
          
          <p>We have processed hundreds of Golden Visa document packages and understand what ICA reviewers look for. Our pre-assessment catches issues before you invest in translation and application fees. Our translations are formatted to ICA expectations. Our attestation coordination ensures proper sequencing. This experience translates into higher first-time approval rates for our clients.</p>

          <h3>MOHESR Attestation for Professionals</h3>
          
          <p>The professional category requires degree certificates attested by MOHESR—the UAE Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research. This attestation confirms your degree is from a recognized institution and is equivalent to UAE standards. The process involves multiple steps: attestation from your home country, UAE Embassy attestation, MOFA attestation, and finally MOHESR equivalency verification.</p>
          
          <p>We coordinate the complete MOHESR attestation chain. For degrees already attested through MOFA, we handle the MOHESR submission. For degrees requiring full attestation, we manage the entire process from your home country through to final MOHESR approval. Once attested, we provide MOJ-certified translation of the complete attested document.</p>

          <h3>Name Consistency Matters</h3>
          
          <p>ICA systems cross-reference names across all submitted documents. If your degree shows "Mohammed Ahmed," your passport shows "Mohamed Ahmad," and your bank statement shows "Mohd Ahmed"—the system may flag inconsistencies that delay processing. This is especially common with names transliterated from Arabic, Hindi, Urdu, or other non-Latin scripts.</p>
          
          <p>We verify name consistency across all documents before translation. Where variations exist, we ensure translations match your passport and Emirates ID exactly. We can provide supporting documentation explaining transliteration variations if needed. This attention to detail prevents the frustrating back-and-forth that delays Golden Visa approvals.</p>

          <h3>Financial Documentation Requirements</h3>
          
          <p>Financial documents must clearly demonstrate you meet category thresholds. For professionals, bank statements should show consistent salary deposits of AED 30,000+ monthly over at least 6 months. For investors, documents must prove property ownership or investment value of AED 2 million or more. Statements should be recent, show your name as account holder, and include clear transaction details.</p>
          
          <p>We translate bank statements with attention to the details reviewers check: account holder names, transaction descriptions, running balances, and date ranges. Multi-page statements are translated completely with consistent formatting. For property investors, we translate title deeds with precise property descriptions that match DLD records.</p>
