Only after this chain is complete should translation occur. We review your documents to confirm attestation status before quoting.'

        heading: 'Property Purchase & Registration',

      {
        heading: 'Employment & Labour Disputes',

        heading: 'Family Law Matters',

const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What makes a translation legal in the UAE?',
    answer: 'A legal translation in the UAE must be performed by a translator registered with the Ministry of Justice (MOJ). The completed translation bears the translator official stamp, signature, serial number, and a QR code that government entities scan to verify authenticity. Without these elements, the translation has no legal standing and will be rejected by courts, notaries, and government departments.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does legal translation take?',
    answer: 'Standard legal documents (contracts, POAs, certificates) are completed within 60 minutes to 24 hours depending on length and complexity. Lengthy court judgments or technical agreements may require 2-3 business days. We provide exact timelines after reviewing your document—rush processing is available for urgent matters.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you translate documents for DIFC and ADGM?',
    answer: 'Yes. DIFC and ADGM operate under common law frameworks with English as the primary language. We provide translations using appropriate common law terminology for wills, trusts, corporate governance documents, and commercial agreements destined for these jurisdictions. Our translators understand the distinction between civil law and common law legal concepts.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate documents that are not yet attested?',
    answer: 'We can translate unattested documents, but the translation may not be accepted for official purposes. We always check attestation status first and advise on the proper sequence. Typically: get attestation completed first, then translate. This prevents paying for a translation that cannot be used.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if the government rejects my translation?',
    answer: 'If a government entity rejects a translation we provided due to our error, we correct it immediately at no charge and redeliver. We also cover courier costs for physical redelivery. Our acceptance guarantee reflects our confidence in our MOJ-certified process—we handle thousands of submissions monthly and know what each authority requires.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to visit your office?',
    answer: 'No. Our entire workflow operates via WhatsApp and secure file transfer. Send your document, receive the quote, approve, pay online, and receive your completed translation digitally. Physical copies can be couriered anywhere in the UAE. We designed this process for busy professionals who cannot take time off work for document errands.'

      <h2>The Complete Guide to Legal Translation in the UAE</h2>

      <p>The UAE legal system operates across multiple jurisdictions, each with distinct language requirements and acceptance standards. Whether you need documents for <a href="/locations/dubai/">Dubai</a> mainland courts, <a href="/locations/dubai/difc/">DIFC</a>, or <a href="/locations/abu-dhabi/">Abu Dhabi</a> authorities, understanding these requirements before you begin saves time, money, and the frustration of rejected submissions.</p>

      <h3>Why Legal Translation Differs from Standard Translation</h3>

      <p>Legal translation is not simply converting words from one language to another. Legal terminology carries precise meaning developed over centuries of case law and statutory interpretation. A lease is not merely rent—it encompasses specific rights, obligations, and remedies that differ between legal systems.</p>

      <p>In the UAE context, this complexity multiplies. The country operates civil law courts (<a href="/locations/dubai/">Dubai Courts</a>, Abu Dhabi Judicial Department) alongside common law jurisdictions (DIFC, ADGM). A <a href="/legal/corporate/poa/">Power of Attorney</a> translated for Dubai Courts uses different terminology than one destined for DIFC registration. Our translators understand these distinctions because they work with both systems daily.</p>

      <h3>The Hierarchy of Legal Documents in UAE Proceedings</h3>

      <p>Courts and authorities weight documents differently based on their certification level. A document with the full <a href="/services/attestation/">attestation chain</a> (origin country notarization, foreign ministry, UAE embassy, <a href="/services/attestation/">MOFA</a>) plus MOJ-certified translation carries maximum evidentiary weight. Documents missing attestation steps may be admitted but given less consideration.</p>

      <p>For commercial matters, this hierarchy determines whether <a href="/legal/contracts/">contracts</a> are enforceable and whether <a href="/legal/corporate/">corporate documents</a> are valid. We advise clients on the minimum certification level required for their specific use case—sometimes full attestation is necessary, sometimes MOJ translation alone suffices.</p>

      <h3>Cost Factors in Legal Translation</h3>

      <p>Legal translation pricing depends on several factors beyond simple word count. Technical complexity matters: a standard <a href="/legal/contracts/">employment contract</a> translates faster than a <a href="/industries/pharmaceutical/">pharmaceutical</a> licensing agreement filled with <a href="/specialized-translation/">specialized terminology</a>. Document condition affects cost—faded photocopies require more careful handling than clear originals. Urgency carries a premium because rush jobs require rearranging translator schedules.</p>

      <p>We provide fixed quotes after reviewing your document, never after. The price we quote includes the MOJ stamp, digital delivery, and any standard formatting. We do not add fees for processing or certification after the fact.</p>
