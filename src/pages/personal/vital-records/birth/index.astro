  {
    question: 'What birth certificate formats do you translate?',
    answer: 'We translate birth certificates from any country in any language. Short-form (computerized extract), long-form (full registration details), hospital birth records, and delayed registration certificates. Each format is handled according to its specific structure.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why does my child birth certificate need translation?',
    answer: 'Birth certificates are required for dependent visa applications, school enrollment (KHDA requires certified translation for UAE schools), and establishing legal relationship for inheritance and guardianship matters. The Arabic translation becomes part of your child official UAE records.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Does the birth certificate need attestation?',
    answer: 'For dependent visa applications, foreign birth certificates typically need attestation before translation. The chain includes home country authentication, UAE Embassy attestation, and MOFA. For some school enrollments, attested translation may not be required—we advise based on your specific need.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle parent names?',
    answer: 'Parent names must match passport spellings exactly. We verify names against provided passport copies when available. This is critical for visa applications where immigration systems match names strictly.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate birth certificates for UAE-born children?',
    answer: 'UAE birth certificates are issued in Arabic, so translation into English may be needed for international use. We provide English translations of UAE birth certificates for embassy submissions, foreign school applications, or international travel requirements.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What about delayed registration birth certificates?',
    answer: 'Some countries issue delayed registration certificates when births are registered after the normal period. These have different formats and may include court orders. We handle these documents understanding their specific legal context.'

      <h2>Birth Certificate Translation for Family Life in UAE</h2>
      <p>Bringing your family to the UAE requires documentation that proves relationships. The birth certificate is the foundational document establishing that your child is indeed your child—essential for visa sponsorship, school enrollment, and family benefits.</p>
      
      <p>Different countries issue birth certificates in vastly different formats. Indian birth certificates look nothing like UK ones. Chinese certificates include characters that must be transliterated properly. Each country has its own conventions that our translators understand.</p>
      
      <p>Name consistency across documents is critical. If your child's name appears differently on their birth certificate and passport, this creates complications. We flag these issues before they become problems at the immigration counter or school registration desk.</p>
