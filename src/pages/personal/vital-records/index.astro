  {
    question: 'What documents count as vital records in the UAE?',
    answer: 'Vital records are official government documents that record key life events: birth certificates, marriage certificates, divorce decrees/certificates, and death certificates. In UAE context, these documents are required for visa applications, family sponsorship, inheritance matters, and various government procedures. All must be translated by MOJ-certified translators for official use.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do my vital records need attestation before translation?',
    answer: 'For UAE government submissions, foreign vital records typically require the full attestation chain: notarization in the country of issue, authentication by that country\'s foreign ministry, attestation by the UAE embassy, and finally MOFA attestation in the UAE. We check attestation status before quoting and can guide you through the process if stamps are missing.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I get my birth certificate translated for a UAE visa?',
    answer: 'Send us a clear scan of your attested birth certificate via WhatsApp. We verify the document is complete and legible, provide a quote, and upon approval, our MOJ-certified translator produces the Arabic translation with official stamp. Digital delivery within hours; physical copies couriered same-day if needed.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why do UAE authorities need translated vital records?',
    answer: 'Arabic is the official language of UAE government and judicial proceedings. Authorities cannot process documents they cannot read. Translated vital records are required for visa applications, family sponsorship at GDRFA, school enrollment, inheritance proceedings in Personal Status Court, and various other official matters.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if names are spelled differently on my documents?',
    answer: 'Name consistency is critical—discrepancies cause 40% of government rejections. We verify that translated names match exactly how they appear on your passport and Emirates ID. If discrepancies exist in your source documents, we flag them before translation so you can address the issue with issuing authorities.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate vital records from any country?',
    answer: 'Yes. We translate vital records from all countries, in 43+ languages. Common origins include India, Pakistan, Philippines, UK, US, Egypt, Jordan, and European countries. Each country has different document formats, but our translators are experienced with international vital record conventions.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long are translated vital records valid?',
    answer: 'The translation itself does not expire. However, some government procedures require documents issued within specific timeframes. For example, marriage certificates for spouse visa applications are typically accepted regardless of age, while other documents may need to be recently issued. We advise on requirements for your specific use case.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you translate vital records for DIFC and ADGM?',
    answer: 'Yes. While DIFC and ADGM operate in English, certain proceedings (especially those involving family law or inheritance) may require Arabic translations for coordination with mainland courts. We provide translations formatted for both common law and civil law jurisdictions.'

      <h2>Why Vital Records Translation Matters in the UAE</h2>
      
      <p>The UAE's administrative systems require documented proof for virtually every family-related process. Your children cannot be added to your visa without translated birth certificates. Your spouse cannot be sponsored without a translated marriage certificate. Inheritance cannot be distributed without translated death certificates. These are not optional conveniences—they are mandatory requirements.</p>
      
      <h3>The Attestation Chain</h3>
      
      <p>For vital records issued outside the UAE, a multi-step attestation process typically precedes translation. This chain establishes the document's authenticity before UAE authorities will accept it:</p>
      
      <ol style="line-height: 2; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
        <li><strong>Notarization</strong> in the country where the document was issued</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication</strong> by that country's foreign ministry (or state department for US documents)</li>
        <li><strong>Attestation</strong> by the UAE Embassy in that country</li>
        <li><strong>MOFA Attestation</strong> in the UAE (Ministry of Foreign Affairs)</li>
        <li><strong>Translation</strong> by an MOJ-certified translator</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>This sequence matters. Translation before attestation may be rejected because authorities cannot verify the stamps were present before translation. We always check your document's attestation status and advise on the correct sequence.</p>
      
      <div class="category-info-box">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Common Rejection Reasons</h3>
        <p>Government counters reject vital records translations for several preventable reasons: name spelling doesn't match passport exactly, document is missing required attestation stamps, scan quality is too poor to read dates or signatures, or the document has expired (for time-sensitive uses). We verify all these factors before beginning translation.</p>
      </div>
      
      <h3>Country-Specific Considerations</h3>
      
      <p>Vital records from different countries have unique characteristics our translators understand:</p>
      
      <p><strong>India:</strong> Birth certificates may be issued by municipal corporations, gram panchayats, or hospitals depending on location and era. Marriage certificates come from registrars under different state-level marriage acts. We're familiar with all Indian vital record formats.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Philippines:</strong> PSA-issued certificates have specific security features. Church marriage certificates must be distinguished from civil registration. Birth certificates may need to be authenticated through DFA (Department of Foreign Affairs).</p>
      
      <p><strong>UK:</strong> Full birth certificates vs. short-form certificates serve different purposes. Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish documents have different formats than English ones. We handle all UK variations.</p>
      
      <p><strong>US:</strong> Each state issues vital records differently. Apostille from the Secretary of State may substitute for embassy attestation under the Hague Convention for certain uses.</p>

      <h2>Common Use Cases for Vital Records</h2>
      
      <h3>Family Visa Sponsorship</h3>
      <p>Sponsoring family members through GDRFA (General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs) requires translated vital records proving the relationship. For children: birth certificates showing parentage. For spouses: marriage certificates proving the union. For parents: birth certificates establishing the relationship chain. All must be attested and translated to Arabic.</p>
      
      <h3>School Enrollment</h3>
      <p>Schools in Dubai require translated birth certificates to verify a child's age and identity. Some schools also require translated immunization records. KHDA-regulated schools have specific documentation requirements that we're familiar with.</p>
      
      <h3>Inheritance and Personal Status Court</h3>
      <p>When someone passes away in the UAE—or when UAE assets are involved in an inheritance—the Personal Status Court requires translated vital records. Death certificates establish the passing. Birth certificates establish who the heirs are. Marriage certificates establish spousal rights. These translations directly affect how assets are distributed.</p>
      
      <h3>Status Changes and Updates</h3>
      <p>Life changes require documentation. A divorce certificate updates your marital status for future marriage applications. A death certificate removes a deceased family member from records. A birth certificate for a newborn starts their official record. We help with translations for all life transitions.</p>
