  {
    question: 'What documents count as vital records for UAE purposes?',
    answer: 'Vital records include birth, marriage, divorce, and death certificates. UAE requires them for visa sponsorship, family status updates, school enrollment, and court proceedings. Foreign vital records must be translated by MOJ-certified translators.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do my vital records need attestation before translation?',
    answer: 'For most UAE government submissions, yes. The chain includes notarization, foreign ministry authentication, UAE Embassy, and MOFA. We check attestation status during document review and tell you if stamps are missing. Translating unattested documents wastes money—they get rejected.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I get my birth certificate translated for a UAE visa application?',
    answer: 'Send us a clear scan of your attested birth certificate via WhatsApp. We verify the document is complete (all required stamps present), legible (dates and names clearly readable), and ready for translation. Upon approval of our quote, our MOJ-certified translator produces the Arabic translation with official stamp and QR verification code. You receive the digital copy within hours; physical copies can be couriered same-day within Dubai or next-day across the UAE.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why do UAE authorities require translated vital records?',
    answer: 'Arabic is the official language of UAE government and judicial proceedings. Authorities cannot process documents they cannot read. Required for visa applications, family sponsorship, school enrollment, and court proceedings. MOJ certification confirms translation accuracy.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if names are spelled differently across my documents?',
    answer: 'Name consistency is critical—spelling differences cause 40% of rejections. We verify names match your passport and Emirates ID exactly. If your birth certificate differs (common with transliterated names), we flag this. You may need a name correction affidavit. We advise on the best approach.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate vital records from any country?',
    answer: 'Yes. We translate vital records from all countries in 43+ languages. Common origins include India, Pakistan, Philippines, UK, USA, and Middle Eastern countries. Each country has different formats. Our translators are experienced with international vital record conventions.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long are translated vital records valid in the UAE?',
    answer: 'The translation itself does not expire—once certified, it remains valid indefinitely. However, some government procedures require the underlying document to be recently issued. For example, police clearance certificates for visa applications typically must be issued within 3-6 months. Birth and marriage certificates are generally accepted regardless of issue date since the underlying facts do not change. We advise on specific validity requirements for your intended use during our initial consultation.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you translate vital records for DIFC and ADGM proceedings?',
    answer: 'Yes. DIFC and ADGM operate in English but some proceedings need Arabic for mainland courts. This is common in family law where Personal Status Court has jurisdiction. We format translations for both common law and civil law courts.'

  heroIntro={`<p>Vital records document the defining moments of your life—and in the UAE, they're required for nearly every major administrative process. From sponsoring family members to settling inheritance matters, these translations must be precise, properly attested, and MOJ-certified.</p>

<h3>The Four Vital Records</h3>
<p><a href="/personal/vital-records/birth/">Birth certificates</a>, <a href="/personal/vital-records/marriage/">marriage certificates</a>, <a href="/personal/vital-records/divorce/">divorce certificates</a>, and <a href="/personal/vital-records/death/">death certificates</a> establish your family status. These determine visa eligibility, sponsorship rights, marital status in official records, and inheritance matters.</p>

<h3>Birth Certificates</h3>
<p>The first vital record expatriates need. <strong>GDRFA</strong> requires proof of parent-child relationship for dependent visas. <strong>KHDA schools</strong> need official documentation. Emirates ID and health insurance require translated birth certificates. We handle all formats—short-form, long-form, hospital records, delayed registration.</p>

<h3>Marriage Certificates</h3>
<p>Establishes legal marital status affecting spouse visa eligibility at GDRFA, joint property at DLD, bank accounts, and insurance. We handle civil certificates, religious certificates (Nikah Nama, church records), and court marriage certificates.</p>

<h3>Divorce Certificates</h3>
<p>Updates your civil status when a marriage ends. Needed for visa updates, remarriage permission through Dubai Courts, custody matters, and <a href="/legal/wills/">will</a> updates. We handle simple certificates through complex decrees with custody and property provisions.</p>

<h3>Death Certificates</h3>
<p>Enables settlement of deceased person's affairs. Banks freeze accounts until translated documentation is provided. DLD requires translation for property transfer to heirs. Insurance claims and probate proceedings also require translation.</p>

<h3>Attestation Requirements</h3>
<p><a href="/services/attestation/">Attestation</a> is typically required before vital records have legal effect. The chain includes home country authentication, UAE Embassy attestation, and UAE MOFA attestation. We verify status during document review.</p>

<h3>Name Consistency</h3>
<p>UAE systems match names character by character. Discrepancies between vital records and passports cause rejections. We verify name spelling before translation and flag variations that could cause problems.</p>`}

      <h2>Why Vital Records Translation Matters in the UAE</h2>
      
      <p>The UAE's administrative systems require documented proof for virtually every family-related process. Your children cannot be added to your residence visa without translated birth certificates proving parentage. Your spouse cannot be sponsored without a translated marriage certificate proving the union. Inheritance cannot be distributed without translated death certificates establishing the passing and translated birth certificates establishing who the heirs are. These are not optional conveniences—they are mandatory requirements enforced at every government counter.</p>
      
      <h3>The Attestation Chain Explained</h3>
      
      <p>For vital records issued outside the UAE, a multi-step attestation process typically precedes translation. This chain establishes the document's authenticity before UAE authorities will accept it. The sequence matters—translation before attestation may be rejected because authorities cannot verify the stamps were present before translation occurred.</p>

        <h3><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Common Rejection Reasons We Help You Avoid</h3>
        <p>Government counters reject vital records translations for several preventable reasons: name spelling doesn't match passport exactly (the most common issue with transliterated names), document is missing one or more required attestation stamps, scan quality is too poor to read dates or signatures clearly, the document has been altered or has visible corrections without official certification, or the translation was done by a non-MOJ-certified translator. We verify all these factors before beginning translation work.</p>

      <h2>Country-Specific Considerations</h2>
      
      <p>Vital records from different countries have unique characteristics, formats, and attestation requirements. Our translators are experienced with documents from all major source countries.</p>
      
      <h3>India</h3>
      <p>Indian birth certificates may be issued by municipal corporations (for urban births), gram panchayats (for rural births), or hospitals (older certificates). Marriage certificates come from registrars operating under different state-level marriage acts—the Hindu Marriage Act, Special Marriage Act, or various personal law frameworks. We're familiar with all Indian vital record formats including digitally-issued certificates from the CRS portal. Indian documents require attestation from MEA (Ministry of External Affairs) before UAE Embassy attestation.</p>
      
      <h3>Philippines</h3>
      <p>PSA (Philippine Statistics Authority) issued certificates have specific security features we verify for authenticity. Church marriage certificates from Catholic parishes must be distinguished from civil registration—for UAE purposes, the civil registration is typically required. Birth certificates may need authentication through DFA (Department of Foreign Affairs) followed by UAE Embassy attestation. We handle both NSO-era certificates and current PSA documents.</p>
      
      <h3>United Kingdom</h3>
      <p>UK documents come in different formats depending on the constituent country. GRO certificates from England and Wales differ from Scottish certificates issued by NRS (National Records of Scotland) and Northern Irish certificates from GRONI. Full birth certificates contain more information than short-form certificates—verify which format your intended use requires. UK documents require FCO (Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office) apostille rather than embassy attestation due to the Hague Convention.</p>
      
      <h3>United States</h3>
      <p>Each US state issues vital records differently with varying formats and security features. Attestation requires apostille from the Secretary of State of the issuing state (not the federal State Department for most documents). The apostille substitutes for embassy attestation under the Hague Convention. Some UAE uses may additionally require MOFA attestation after the apostille. We advise on the specific chain required for your intended use.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="section bg-light">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Common Use Cases for Vital Records</h2>
      
      <h3>Family Visa Sponsorship</h3>
      <p>Sponsoring family members through GDRFA (General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs) requires translated vital records proving the family relationship. For children: birth certificates showing you as a parent. For spouses: marriage certificates proving the union is legally recognized. For parents: your birth certificate establishing you as their child. All documents must be attested and translated to Arabic. The sponsorship application will be rejected if any document is missing or improperly translated.</p>
      
      <h3>School Enrollment</h3>
      <p>Schools in Dubai regulated by KHDA require translated birth certificates to verify a child's age and identity for enrollment and grade placement. Some schools also require translated immunization records and previous school transcripts. International schools may accept English documents, but Arabic translations are required if any issue escalates to education authorities. We're familiar with KHDA documentation requirements and can advise on what you'll need.</p>
      
      <h3>Inheritance and Personal Status Court</h3>
      <p>When someone passes away in the UAE—or when UAE assets are involved in an inheritance regardless of where the death occurred—the Personal Status Court requires translated vital records. Death certificates establish that the passing occurred and the date. Birth certificates establish who the legal heirs are and their relationship to the deceased. Marriage certificates establish spousal rights to inheritance. These translations directly affect how assets worth potentially millions of dirhams are distributed. Accuracy is not optional.</p>
      
      <h3>Status Changes and Government Updates</h3>
      <p>Life changes require documentation. A divorce certificate updates your marital status for future marriage applications or to modify existing records. A death certificate removes a deceased family member from sponsorship records and property registrations. A birth certificate for a newborn starts their official record in the UAE. We help with translations for all life transitions, ensuring your records accurately reflect your current circumstances.</p>

      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <span class="timeline-title">1. Document Verification</span>
          <p>Send your vital record via WhatsApp. We check that the document is legible (all text, dates, and signatures clearly visible), verify that required attestation stamps are present, and confirm the document type matches your stated purpose. If anything needs attention—missing stamps, poor image quality, wrong document type—we tell you immediately before any work begins.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <span class="timeline-title">2. Name Consistency Check</span>
          <p>We compare names on your vital record against your passport and Emirates ID (if you have one). Any discrepancies are flagged before translation begins. This single verification step prevents the most common reason for government rejection. If we find inconsistencies, we discuss options: using the exact source spelling with a note, or obtaining a name correction affidavit first.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <span class="timeline-title">3. MOJ-Certified Translation</span>
          <p>Our certified translator renders your document into Arabic with exact preservation of all details: names (with consistent transliteration), dates (converted to both Gregorian and Hijri where appropriate), registration numbers, issuing authority details, and all official notations. Nothing is paraphrased or summarized—every element of your vital record transfers to the translation.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <span class="timeline-title">4. Certification & Delivery</span>
          <p>The official MOJ stamp and QR verification code are applied to the translation. You receive the certified digital copy immediately via WhatsApp and email. Physical copies with original stamps can be couriered anywhere in the UAE—same-day delivery within Dubai, next-day to other emirates. We confirm delivery and remain available if you have questions when submitting.</p>
