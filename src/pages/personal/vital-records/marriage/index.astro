      question: "What if my marriage certificate is in a language other than English?",
      answer: "We translate marriage certificates from virtually any language. For documents not in English or Arabic, we may use a two-step process depending on the requirements of the receiving authority. Let us know the original language when you submit, and we will advise on the best approach."

      answer: "For most official UAE uses, yes. Foreign marriage certificates typically need to go through the attestation chain before translation. We review each case individually and advise you before proceeding, so you do not spend money on translation that will not be accepted without attestation."
