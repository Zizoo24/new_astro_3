const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What marriage certificate formats do you translate?',
    answer: 'We translate all marriage certificate formats: religious certificates (Muslim Nikah Nama, Christian marriage certificates, Hindu marriage documents), civil certificates from any country, court marriage certificates, and UAE marriage contracts. Each format has specific terminology that our translators understand.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why is spouse name accuracy so important?',
    answer: 'Immigration and banking systems match names exactly. If your marriage certificate shows "Mohammad" but your passport shows "Mohammed," this creates problems. We verify names against passports when available and flag any discrepancies that could cause rejection.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Does my marriage certificate need attestation?',
    answer: 'For UAE government use, foreign marriage certificates typically need attestation before translation. The chain includes: home country authentication, UAE Embassy attestation, and MOFA. For some purposes like bank account changes, attested translation may not be required—we advise based on your specific need.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle religious marriage certificates?',
    answer: 'Religious certificates often include specific religious terminology and may be in languages like Urdu (Nikah Nama), Hindi, or Arabic. Our translators understand the religious context and use appropriate Arabic equivalents that UAE authorities recognize.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate marriage certificates for court cases?',
    answer: 'Yes. Marriage certificates are frequently needed for Personal Status Court matters—divorce proceedings, inheritance cases, and custody disputes. We format translations to meet court submission requirements and can provide multiple certified copies.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What about same-country UAE marriages?',
    answer: 'UAE marriage contracts issued by UAE courts or authorized religious authorities may already be in Arabic. If you need English translation (for international use) or additional certified copies, we can assist with that as well.'

      <h2>Marriage Certificate Translation for UAE Life</h2>
      <p>Your marriage certificate is referenced throughout your UAE experience—from the initial spouse visa application to property purchases, bank accounts, and eventually inheritance planning. The Arabic translation becomes part of your permanent record with UAE authorities.</p>
      
      <p>Different certificate formats present different challenges. A Nikah Nama includes religious terminology that must be rendered appropriately. A UK civil certificate uses formal legal language. An Indian marriage certificate may be in Hindi or a regional language. Our translators have experience with all formats.</p>
      
      <p>We pay particular attention to name consistency. Your spouse's name must appear exactly as it does on their passport. Any variation—even Mohamed vs Mohammed—can cause visa rejections or banking complications. We verify this detail before finalizing your translation.</p>
