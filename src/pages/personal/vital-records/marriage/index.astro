    question: 'What marriage certificate formats do you translate?',
    answer: 'We translate all marriage certificate formats: religious certificates (Muslim Nikah Nama, Christian marriage certificates, Hindu marriage documents), civil certificates from any country, court marriage certificates, and UAE marriage contracts. Each format has specific terminology that our translators understand.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why is spouse name accuracy so important?',
    answer: 'Immigration and banking systems match names exactly. If your marriage certificate shows "Mohammad" but your passport shows "Mohammed," this creates problems. We verify names against passports when available and flag any discrepancies that could cause rejection.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Does my marriage certificate need attestation?',
    answer: 'For UAE government use, foreign marriage certificates typically need attestation before translation. The chain includes: home country authentication, UAE Embassy attestation, and MOFA. For some purposes like bank account changes, attested translation may not be required—we advise based on your specific need.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle religious marriage certificates?',
    answer: 'Religious certificates often include specific religious terminology and may be in languages like Urdu (Nikah Nama), Hindi, or Arabic. Our translators understand the religious context and use appropriate Arabic equivalents that UAE authorities recognize.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate marriage certificates for court cases?',
    answer: 'Yes. Marriage certificates are frequently needed for Personal Status Court matters—divorce proceedings, inheritance cases, and custody disputes. We format translations to meet court submission requirements and can provide multiple certified copies.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What about same-country UAE marriages?',
    answer: 'UAE marriage contracts issued by UAE courts or authorized religious authorities may already be in Arabic. If you need English translation (for international use) or additional certified copies, we can assist with that as well.'

  heroIntro={`<p>Marriage certificates establish legal relationships that affect visas, property, banking, and inheritance in the UAE. Whether your certificate is a civil document, religious record, or foreign registration, we provide certified translations that UAE authorities accept for all official purposes.</p>

<h3>Why Marriage Certificates Matter in UAE</h3>
<p>Your marriage certificate becomes the official record of your marital status in UAE systems. <span class="hero-highlight">GDRFA</span> uses it for spouse visa applications. <span class="hero-highlight">DLD</span> requires it for joint property ownership registration. Banks need it for joint accounts and name changes. Courts use it to establish spousal inheritance rights and in Personal Status Court proceedings.</p>

<h3>Common Uses in the UAE</h3>
<div class="hero-feature-grid">
<div class="hero-feature-item"><strong>Spouse Visa Applications</strong> GDRFA requires certified translation for dependent residency sponsorship</div>
<div class="hero-feature-item"><strong>Property Transactions</strong> DLD requires proof of marriage for joint ownership registration</div>
<div class="hero-feature-item"><strong>Bank Account Updates</strong> Adding spouse to accounts or changing names after marriage</div>
<div class="hero-feature-item"><strong>Personal Status Court</strong> Divorce proceedings, inheritance, and custody matters</div>
<div class="hero-feature-item"><strong>Insurance & Benefits</strong> Adding spouse to health insurance and beneficiary designations</div>
<div class="hero-feature-item"><strong>Will Registration</strong> DIFC Wills require proof of marital status for spousal provisions</div>
</div>

<h3>Name Consistency—Critical for Visas</h3>
<p>GDRFA's system matches names character by character with zero tolerance for variations. If your certificate shows "Fatima Mohammed" but the passport shows "Fatimah Muhammad," the system flags a mismatch and rejects the application. This is the most common reason for spouse visa delays. We verify both spouse names against passports before translation begins and advise on resolutions.</p>

<blockquote class="hero-pullquote">We verify spouse names against passport spellings before translation—preventing visa rejection due to name mismatches that cost couples weeks of delays.</blockquote>

<h3>Certificate Formats We Handle</h3>
<p>Civil certificates from government registrars worldwide. Religious certificates—<span class="hero-highlight">Nikah Nama</span>, Christian certificates, Hindu vivah patra, Jewish ketubah. Court marriage certificates. Consular marriages registered at embassies. Each format has specific terminology and our translators understand the religious and legal context.</p>

<div class="hero-divider">Attestation Requirements</div>

<table class="hero-table">
<thead><tr><th>Country Origin</th><th>Hague Member</th><th>Process Required</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>India</td><td>Yes (2005)</td><td>MEA Apostille → Translation</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pakistan</td><td>No</td><td>Full attestation chain</td></tr>
<tr><td>Philippines</td><td>Yes (2019)</td><td>DFA Apostille → Translation</td></tr>
<tr><td>UK / USA / Canada</td><td>Yes</td><td>National Apostille → Translation</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Religious Certificate Specifics</h3>
<p>A Nikah Nama contains specific Islamic terminology that must be rendered accurately in Arabic—the witnesses (shahid), mehr (dower) amount, the officiating religious official, and the Islamic date. Christian certificates include church name, officiant designation, and religious witnesses. Hindu vivah patra includes the pandit details and religious rituals performed. These terms have established Arabic equivalents that UAE authorities expect to see.</p>

<h3>Attestation Process</h3>
<p>Foreign marriage certificates typically need the full <a href="/services/attestation/">attestation</a> chain: home country authentication, UAE Embassy attestation, and MOFA attestation. Countries in the <a href="/services/attestation/apostille/">Hague Apostille Convention</a> follow a simpler process. Some bank changes may accept unattested translations, but visa applications require the complete chain. We advise on your specific requirements.</p>

      <h2>What You Need to Know About Marriage Certificate Translation</h2>

      <h3>The Real Question: Will This Work for Spouse Sponsorship?</h3>
      <p>If you are sponsoring your spouse in the UAE, GDRFA needs one thing: proof that you are legally married. The marriage certificate translation is not a formality. It becomes the official record of your marriage in UAE government systems. Every detail must be accurate because this document follows you through visa renewals, property purchases, and potentially court matters.</p>

      <p>GDRFA (General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs) accepts marriage certificates from any country, in any format. Civil ceremonies, religious ceremonies, court registrations. The requirement is that the translation is MOJ-certified and the original document has proper attestation.</p>

      <h3>How Marriage Certificate Translation Works in the UAE</h3>
      <p>The process depends on your certificate type and origin country:</p>

      <div class="process-breakdown">
        <h4>For Civil Certificates from Hague Countries</h4>
        <p>If your marriage certificate is from a Hague Convention member country (UK, USA, India, Philippines, Canada, most European countries), you need an apostille from your home country. India has been a member since July 2005. Canada joined in January 2024. After apostille, bring the certificate to Dubai for Arabic translation. No embassy attestation needed.</p>

        <h4>For Religious Certificates</h4>
        <p>Religious marriage certificates (Nikah Nama, Christian church certificates, Hindu marriage documents) often require additional steps. Some religious certificates are not officially registered with government authorities in your home country. In these cases, you may need to register the marriage first, then obtain an official certificate for attestation.</p>

        <h4>For Non-Hague Countries</h4>
        <p>Pakistan is not a Hague member. If your Nikah Nama is from Pakistan, you need the full attestation chain: MOFA Pakistan, UAE Embassy in Pakistan, and MOFA UAE. This adds time but is essential for UAE acceptance.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Spouse Visa Requirements at GDRFA</h3>
      <p>For spouse residency visa applications, you will submit:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Attested and translated marriage certificate</li>
        <li>Sponsor's passport and visa copy</li>
        <li>Sponsor's Emirates ID</li>
        <li>Sponsor's salary certificate or employment contract</li>
        <li>Tenancy contract (Ejari)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The marriage certificate translation must match passport name spellings exactly. GDRFA's system does character-by-character matching. A single letter difference causes application rejection.</p>

      <h3>Beyond Visas: Where Your Marriage Translation Matters</h3>

      <h4>Bank Account Changes</h4>
      <p>Adding your spouse to a joint account or changing account names after marriage requires certified translation. Each bank has slightly different requirements, but all accept MOJ-certified translations. Some banks require the original attested certificate plus translation. Others accept certified copies.</p>

      <h4>Property Transactions at DLD</h4>
      <p>Buying property jointly with your spouse? The Dubai Land Department requires marriage proof for joint title registration. When selling property registered to one spouse, DLD may require marriage translation to verify no spousal consent issues.</p>

      <h4>Health Insurance and Benefits</h4>
      <p>Adding your spouse to company health insurance requires proof of marriage. Most insurance companies accept our translations immediately. For life insurance beneficiary designations, the same documentation applies.</p>

      <h4>Personal Status Court</h4>
      <p>In divorce proceedings, custody disputes, or inheritance matters, the Personal Status Court requires your original marriage documentation. We provide court-formatted translations with multiple certified copies as needed.</p>

      <h3>Common Certificate Formats We Handle</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Nikah Nama (Pakistan, India, Bangladesh):</strong> Urdu text with specific Islamic terminology</li>
        <li><strong>UK Marriage Certificate:</strong> Short form from General Register Office</li>
        <li><strong>US Marriage License:</strong> Varies by state and county</li>
        <li><strong>Indian Marriage Certificate:</strong> State-issued, often bilingual Hindi/English</li>
        <li><strong>Philippine Marriage Certificate:</strong> PSA-issued with security features</li>
        <li><strong>Court Marriage Certificates:</strong> Legal terminology with court stamps</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Name Matching Problem</h3>
      <p>This is the most common cause of spouse visa delays. Your marriage certificate was issued years ago, perhaps with a slightly different name spelling than your current passport. Examples we see regularly:</p>
      <ul class="mistake-list">
        <li>"Mohammad" vs "Mohammed" vs "Muhammad"</li>
        <li>"Fatima" vs "Fathima" vs "Fatimah"</li>
        <li>Middle names included on one document but not the other</li>
        <li>Father's name format differences</li>
        <li>Maiden name vs married name complications</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We check for these discrepancies before you pay. If we spot a mismatch, we advise on solutions: embassy letters, statutory declarations, or court corrections.</p>

      <h3>Realistic Timeline Expectations</h3>
      <p>Standard marriage certificate translation takes 2-4 hours. Express service delivers within 60 minutes. The time-consuming part is attestation if you do not have it. Embassy attestation typically takes 3-7 working days depending on your country's consulate in UAE.</p>

      <div class="info-callout">
        <h4><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> UAE Marriages</h4>
        <p>If you married in the UAE through a UAE court or authorized religious authority, your marriage certificate is already in Arabic. You may need English translation for embassy submissions, international employer requirements, or if relocating abroad.</p>
