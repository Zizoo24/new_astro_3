      <h2>When Passport Translation is Required</h2>
      <div class="content-prose">
        <p>While passports are internationally recognized documents, certain UAE processes require translated versions. The translation confirms identity details in Arabic for authorities who may not read the passport's original language.</p>
        
        <h3>Visa Applications</h3>
        <p>Some visa categories require passport translations as part of the application. This is particularly common for long-term visas, investor visas, and family sponsorship where authorities need detailed identity verification beyond the passport scan alone.</p>
        
        <h3>Property Purchase</h3>
        <p>Dubai Land Department requires passport translation for property registration, especially for non-Latin script passports. Chinese, Russian, and Arabic passports typically need certified translation to ensure all identity details are correctly captured in property records.</p>
        
        <h3>Bank Account Opening</h3>
        <p>Banks conducting enhanced due diligence may request passport translations. This helps ensure the bank's records accurately reflect the account holder's identity as stated in their passport.</p>
        
        <h3>Company Formation</h3>
        <p>When establishing a company in the UAE, shareholders and directors must provide identity documents. For some free zones and mainland authorities, passport translation accompanies the copy for official records.</p>
        
        <h3>Legal Proceedings</h3>
        <p>Courts require Arabic translations of all foreign documents, including passports, when they form part of case evidence or party identification.</p>

      <h2>What We Translate</h2>
      <div class="content-prose">
        <h3>Data Page Translation</h3>
        <p>The most common request is translation of the passport data page—the page containing your photo, name, nationality, date of birth, passport number, and expiry date. This single-page translation serves most purposes including visa applications and bank requirements.</p>
        
        <h3>Full Passport Translation</h3>
        <p>Some processes require translation of additional pages—visa stamps showing travel history, or special notations. We can translate the complete passport when required, including all stamps and endorsements.</p>
        
        <h3>Multi-Language Passports</h3>
        <p>Many passports contain information in multiple languages. We translate from the primary language of the passport, ensuring all details are accurately captured regardless of the original script.</p>
        
        <h3>Expired Passports</h3>
        <p>For certain applications, translation of expired passports may be required to establish historical identity or residence. We translate expired passports with clear notation of their status.</p>

      <h2>Handling Different Scripts</h2>
      <div class="content-prose">
        <p>Passports come in many languages and scripts. Our translators handle all major world languages, ensuring accurate translation regardless of the passport's country of origin.</p>
        
        <h3>Arabic Script Passports</h3>
        <p>Passports from Arabic-speaking countries may need translation to English for certain international or DIFC/ADGM purposes. We translate Arabic passports to English with the same accuracy as English-to-Arabic translations.</p>
        
        <h3>Chinese and Asian Scripts</h3>
        <p>Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and other Asian script passports are commonly presented by investors and business visitors. We translate these passports accurately, handling name transliteration according to established conventions.</p>
        
        <h3>Cyrillic Script</h3>
        <p>Russian, Ukrainian, and other Cyrillic-script passports require translation for UAE processes. We handle transliteration consistently with international standards.</p>
        
        <h3>Latin Script (Non-English)</h3>
        <p>Passports in French, German, Spanish, and other European languages may need translation when authorities require Arabic versions. We translate from all major European languages.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle name transliteration?</h3>
