  heroIntro: `Police clearance certificates are required for many visa applications, employment contracts, and professional licenses in the UAE. Whether your certificate is called a PCC, good conduct certificate, criminal record check, or police verification letter, we provide accurate MOJ-certified translations that meet UAE authority requirements.

<strong>When you need PCC translation in the UAE:</strong>
<ul style="margin: 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.8;">
<li><strong>New employment visas</strong> — MOHRE requires PCCs for most work permit applications</li>
<li><strong>Golden Visa applications</strong> — ICA requests good conduct certificates from your country of residence</li>
<li><strong>Professional licensing</strong> — DHA, Dubai Courts, and other licensing bodies need verified background checks</li>
<li><strong>Family sponsorship</strong> — GDRFA may request PCCs for certain dependent visa categories</li>
</ul>

Police clearance certificates come in different formats depending on the issuing country. India issues Police Clearance Certificates through passport offices or local police stations. The UK provides ACRO certificates (formerly called police certificates). The US issues FBI Identity History Summary for federal clearance and state-level clearances. Each format uses different terminology and layouts that our translators understand.

<strong>Validity matters.</strong> Most UAE authorities require PCCs issued within the past 3-6 months. MOHRE typically accepts certificates up to 6 months old. Golden Visa applications may have stricter requirements. We advise on validity requirements during our document review so you don't waste money translating an expired certificate.

The <a href="/services/attestation/">attestation</a> chain for PCCs depends on the issuing country. Indian PCCs need MEA apostille, UAE Embassy attestation, and MOFA. UK ACRO certificates need FCDO apostille, UAE Embassy, and MOFA. US FBI checks need Department of State apostille, UAE Embassy, and MOFA. We verify attestation status before translation and advise if additional authentication is needed.

Standard PCC translation completes within 2-4 hours. For urgent employment deadlines or visa appointments, express same-day service is available.`,

      <h2>What You Need to Know About PCC Translation</h2>

      <h3>The Real Question: Which Countries' Certificates Do I Need?</h3>
      <p>This depends on your situation. GDRFA and employers have different requirements, and they are not always clear about them. Here is what we see most often:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>New employment visa:</strong> PCC from your current country of residence</li>
        <li><strong>Golden Visa:</strong> PCC from home country plus any country where you lived 6+ months in past 5 years</li>
        <li><strong>Residence renewal:</strong> Only required if you spent extended time outside UAE</li>
        <li><strong>Professional licensing:</strong> DHA requires PCC from home country regardless of current residence</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you have lived in multiple countries, you may need multiple PCCs. We translate all of them with package pricing.</p>

      <h3>PCC Validity Periods</h3>
      <p>Police clearance certificates have expiry dates. This is one of the most common reasons for visa delays:</p>

      <div class="validity-table">
        <div class="validity-row">
          <span class="country">UAE</span>
          <span class="validity">3 months from issue</span>
        </div>
        <div class="validity-row">
          <span class="country">India</span>
          <span class="validity">6 months from issue</span>
        </div>
        <div class="validity-row">
          <span class="country">Pakistan</span>
          <span class="validity">3 months from issue</span>
        </div>
        <div class="validity-row">
          <span class="country">UK</span>
          <span class="validity">6 months from issue (ACRO)</span>
        </div>
        <div class="validity-row">
          <span class="country">USA</span>
          <span class="validity">Varies by state, typically 6 months</span>
        </div>
        <div class="validity-row">
          <span class="country">Philippines</span>
          <span class="validity">6 months from issue (NBI)</span>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>We check the issue date during our review. If your PCC is close to expiry, we tell you before you pay so you can decide whether to proceed or get a fresh one.</p>

      <h3>The Attestation Chain</h3>
      <p>Like other documents, PCCs need attestation for official UAE use. The chain depends on your country:</p>

      <div class="process-breakdown">
        <h4>Hague Convention Countries (India, UK, USA, Philippines, Canada)</h4>
        <p>Your PCC needs an apostille from the issuing authority. For India (Hague member since July 2005), this comes from the MEA. For USA, the Secretary of State for the issuing state handles it. After apostille, bring it to UAE for translation.</p>

        <h4>Non-Hague Countries (Pakistan, Egypt, Nigeria)</h4>
        <p>Full attestation chain: MOFA in home country, UAE Embassy, and MOFA UAE. Pakistan PCCs from FIA or Police require this complete chain.</p>

        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Some PCCs from Pakistan are already in English. You still need Arabic translation for GDRFA. Do not assume English is sufficient.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Different Names for PCC</h3>
      <p>Your country may call this document something else entirely:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>India:</strong> Police Clearance Certificate or Police Verification</li>
        <li><strong>Pakistan:</strong> Police Character Certificate or FIA Character Certificate</li>
        <li><strong>UK:</strong> ACRO Police Certificate or DBS Check</li>
        <li><strong>USA:</strong> FBI Background Check, State Criminal History, or Local Police Clearance</li>
        <li><strong>Philippines:</strong> NBI Clearance</li>
        <li><strong>UAE:</strong> Good Conduct Certificate (from Dubai Police or CID)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All of these serve the same purpose: proving you have no criminal record or disclosing what record exists.</p>

      <h3>What If My PCC Shows an Offense?</h3>
      <p>We translate what the document says. Accurately. We do not modify, omit, or add any information. If your PCC shows a minor offense, traffic violation, or even a serious conviction, the translation will reflect exactly what appears on the original.</p>

      <p>Whether this affects your visa or employment depends on the type of offense and the specific entity reviewing it. Some employers have strict policies. Others evaluate on a case-by-case basis. We cannot advise on the outcome, but we ensure the translation is accurate.</p>

      <h3>Golden Visa PCC Requirements</h3>
      <p>Golden Visa applications have stricter PCC requirements than standard employment visas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>PCC from your home country (where you hold citizenship)</li>
        <li>PCC from any country where you lived for 6+ months in the past 5 years</li>
        <li>All PCCs must be attested and translated</li>
        <li>PCCs should be issued within 3-6 months of application</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The ICP portal will reject incomplete documentation. Having all PCCs translated together ensures consistent formatting.</p>

      <h3>Professional Licensing Requirements</h3>
      <p>If you work in a regulated profession, you need PCC translation for licensing:</p>

      <h4>Healthcare (DHA, DOH, MOHAP)</h4>
      <p>Doctors, nurses, and allied health professionals need PCC from home country. This is part of the dataflow verification process. DHA specifically requires the original attested PCC plus certified translation.</p>

      <h4>Education (MOE, KHDA)</h4>
      <p>Teachers and school administrators need PCC as part of their licensing. Requirements vary by emirate and school type.</p>

      <h4>Finance and Banking</h4>
      <p>Some financial institutions require PCC for senior positions or roles involving access to client funds.</p>

      <h3>What We Check Before Translation</h3>
      <p>Our pre-validation review includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Issue date:</strong> Is the PCC still valid or close to expiry?</li>
        <li><strong>Attestation status:</strong> Does it have required stamps?</li>
        <li><strong>Legibility:</strong> Can we read all details including stamp text?</li>
        <li><strong>Completeness:</strong> Is this the full document or a partial page?</li>
        <li><strong>Name matching:</strong> Does the name match your passport?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This free check prevents you from paying for a translation that will not be accepted.</p>

      <h3>Realistic Timeline</h3>
      <p>Standard PCC translation takes 2-4 hours. Express service delivers in 60 minutes. The document itself is typically one page, so turnaround is fast.</p>

      <p>What takes longer: getting the PCC in the first place. India PCC through Passport Seva takes 2-4 weeks. UK ACRO certificates take 2-3 weeks. FBI background checks from USA take 4-6 weeks. Plan accordingly.</p>

      <div class="info-callout">
        <h4><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> UAE Good Conduct Certificate</h4>
        <p>Need a PCC from UAE itself? The Dubai Police CID issues Good Conduct Certificates. This is already in Arabic, so you may need English translation for embassy submissions or international employers.</p>
