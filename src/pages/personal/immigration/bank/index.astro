  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Can I submit bank statements from multiple banks for Golden Visa?",
      answer: "Yes, you can submit bank statements from multiple banks to demonstrate your financial standing. The key requirement is that all statements cover the same 6-month period and combined balances meet the threshold. We translate all statements as a coordinated package with consistent formatting."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to get original statements from my bank branch?",
      answer: "PDF exports from your online banking portal are generally accepted. The statement should show the bank's official formatting, your account details, and the required date range. If your bank provides certified statements with official stamps, those are also suitable."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle statements with multiple currencies?",
      answer: "We translate the statement exactly as shown, with clear currency notation for each transaction and balance. If helpful, we can note current exchange rates to AED, though authorities typically understand foreign currency figures directly."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does bank statement translation take?",
      answer: "Standard service delivers within 24-48 hours depending on statement length. Express service provides same-day handling. VIP Concierge offers immediate processing. Multi-page statements covering 6 months may require the longer end of these timeframes."
    },
    {
      question: "What if my statement has many pages of transactions?",
      answer: "We translate the complete statement including all transaction pages. Pricing is based on total page count. Send us your statements via WhatsApp for an accurate quote. We can advise if authorities typically need all transaction details or just summary pages."
