      <h2>Documents for UAE Visa Applications</h2>
      <div class="content-prose">
        <p>Different visa types require different supporting documents. While specific requirements vary by visa category and applicant circumstances, certain documents are commonly needed across visa types.</p>
        
        <h3>Employment and Income Documents</h3>
        <p>Visa applications often require proof of employment or income. Employment contracts, salary certificates, bank statements, and tax returns may need translation. These documents demonstrate your financial stability and ability to support yourself (and dependents) in the UAE.</p>
        
        <h3>Educational Certificates</h3>
        <p>Many visa categories require educational qualifications. Degree certificates, diplomas, and transcripts need translation, often accompanied by attestation from originating countries. We translate academic documents from any language.</p>
        
        <h3>Personal Status Documents</h3>
        <p>Marriage certificates, birth certificates, and other civil status documents support family visa applications. These establish relationships between applicants and their dependents. We translate these vital records with attention to the specific terminology UAE authorities expect.</p>
        
        <h3>Medical Documents</h3>
        <p>Health certificates and medical examination reports may need translation for visa processing. These confirm applicants meet health requirements for UAE residence.</p>
        
        <h3>Property Documents</h3>
        <p>Investor visas and Golden Visas often require property documentation—title deeds, sales agreements, or valuation letters. We translate real estate documents for immigration purposes.</p>

      <h2>Visa Types and Translation Needs</h2>
      <div class="content-prose">
        <h3>Employment Visas</h3>
        <p>Standard employment visas require the employment contract, educational certificates, and possibly professional qualifications. We translate these documents to meet MOHRE and General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA) requirements.</p>
        
        <h3>Family Visas</h3>
        <p>Sponsors applying for family visas need translated marriage certificates, birth certificates for children, and proof of relationship. These translations must clearly establish the family relationships claimed in the application.</p>
        
        <h3>Golden Visa</h3>
        <p>The UAE Golden Visa program requires extensive documentation depending on the category—investors, professionals, entrepreneurs, or students. We handle the full range of <a href="/services/golden-visa-translation/">Golden Visa translation</a> requirements.</p>
        
        <h3>Investor Visas</h3>
        <p>Property and business investor visas require documentation of investments—title deeds, company documents, bank statements, and valuation reports. We translate investment documentation for visa purposes.</p>
        
        <h3>Student Visas</h3>
        <p>Student visa applicants need translated academic records, admission letters, and financial support documentation. We work with students and educational institutions on these translations.</p>
        
        <h3>Freelance and Self-Employment Permits</h3>
        <p>Freelance visas require proof of qualifications and professional background. We translate portfolios, certifications, and client references as needed for these applications.</p>

      <h2>Attestation and Translation</h2>
      <div class="content-prose">
        <p>Many visa documents require attestation—a process of official verification by the issuing country and UAE authorities. Translation typically happens after attestation is complete.</p>
        
        <h3>Understanding the Process</h3>
        <p>The typical flow is: original document → home country attestation → MOFA attestation → translation. Some documents may need translation before certain steps. We can advise on the correct sequence for your specific documents.</p>
        
        <h3>Coordinating with PRO Services</h3>
        <p>Many clients work with PRO (Public Relations Officer) services for visa processing. We coordinate with PRO services, receiving documents after attestation and delivering translations ready for submission. This ensures smooth handoffs in the visa process.</p>
        
        <h3>Timing Considerations</h3>
        <p>Visa applications often have deadlines or timing requirements. Translation is typically one of the faster steps—we can turn around most documents within 24-48 hours, with same-day service for urgent matters. Factor translation time into your overall visa timeline.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Do all visa documents need translation?</h3>
          <p>Not necessarily. Some documents may already be in Arabic or English. Requirements vary by visa type and issuing authority. Your PRO or visa consultant can confirm which documents need translation. When in doubt, send us the documents for assessment.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Should I get documents attested before or after translation?</h3>
          <p>Typically, attestation happens before translation. The attested original is translated, and both are submitted together. However, some processes may differ. Check with your visa advisor or contact us for guidance on your specific situation.</p>
