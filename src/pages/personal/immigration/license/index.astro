  heroIntro: `<p>Converting your foreign driving license to a UAE license requires a certified translation as the first step. Whether you are from an approved country eligible for direct conversion or need to go through the full testing process, the RTA requires your license to be translated by an MOJ-certified translator.</p>

<h3>RTA License Conversion Categories</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Approved countries</strong> — USA, UK, Canada, Australia, EU, Japan can convert without testing</li>
<li><strong>Partial exemption</strong> — Some countries require only a road test</li>
<li><strong>Full testing</strong> — Other countries require complete RTA training and tests</li>
</ul>

<h3>What We Translate</h3>
<p>The translation captures all license categories (car, motorcycle, heavy vehicle), issue and expiry dates, license number, and any restrictions. Your license must be valid—expired licenses are not accepted for conversion.</p>

<h3>RTA Process After Translation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Open file at RTA with translated license, passport, visa, Emirates ID</li>
<li>Complete eye test at RTA-approved optician</li>
<li>Approved countries: receive UAE license same day</li>
<li>Testing countries: proceed with theory/practical training</li>
</ul>

<h3>Turnaround</h3>
<p>Standard translation takes <strong>1-2 hours</strong>. Most clients receive their translation while they wait or pick up on their way to the RTA center.</p>`,

      <h2>What You Need to Know About Driving License Conversion</h2>

      <h3>The Real Question: Can I Convert My License Directly?</h3>
      <p>The UAE maintains a list of approved countries whose driving licenses can be converted without taking a driving test. If your country is on this list, conversion is straightforward: translate your license, pass an eye test, complete the paperwork, and receive your UAE license.</p>

      <p>If your country is not on the approved list, you will need to take driving lessons at an RTA-approved school and pass the UAE driving test. The translated license is still required for your file opening.</p>

      <h3>Approved Countries for Direct Conversion</h3>
      <p>The RTA allows direct license conversion for holders of licenses from these countries:</p>

      <div class="country-grid">

            <li>South Africa</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>This list changes occasionally. If you are unsure about your country, send us your license and we can confirm.</p>

      <h3>Countries Requiring Driving Test</h3>
      <p>If your country is not on the approved list, you need to complete driving lessons and pass the RTA test. Common nationalities requiring the test include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka</li>
        <li>Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam</li>
        <li>Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria</li>
        <li>Nigeria, Kenya, Ethiopia</li>
        <li>China (Mainland)</li>
        <li>Most South American countries</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The number of required lessons varies. Some driving schools offer reduced lesson packages for experienced drivers. Your translated license helps establish your driving history.</p>

      <h3>The Step-by-Step Process</h3>

      <div class="process-breakdown">
        <h4>Step 1: Get Your License Translated</h4>
        <p>Before anything else at RTA, you need an MOJ-certified Arabic translation of your driving license. This is what you are getting from us. Without it, RTA cannot open your file.</p>

        <h4>Step 2: Prepare Your Documents</h4>
        <p>Gather: original driving license, passport with valid visa, Emirates ID, translated license, and two passport photos. Some nationalities need NOC letter from sponsor.</p>

        <h4>Step 3: Eye Test</h4>
        <p>Visit any approved optician or the eye test center at RTA. This takes about 15 minutes and costs around AED 150-200. You will receive a printed certificate valid for the application.</p>

        <h4>Step 4: Typing Center</h4>
        <p>Visit a typing center near RTA. They will enter your details into the system using your translated license. Fee is around AED 250 for the application and issuance.</p>

        <h4>Step 5: RTA Submission</h4>
        <p>Submit your file at RTA. If from approved country, you receive your UAE license same day or next day. If testing required, you will be directed to register at a driving school.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>License Categories That Can Be Converted</h3>
      <p>Your translation will include all categories on your original license:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Category 1/A (Motorcycle):</strong> Can be converted from approved countries</li>
        <li><strong>Category 2/B (Light Vehicle):</strong> Most common conversion, standard car license</li>
        <li><strong>Category 3 (Heavy Vehicle):</strong> Additional requirements for commercial licenses</li>
        <li><strong>Category 4 (Bus):</strong> Passenger transport license, extra documentation needed</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic vs Manual:</strong> UAE licenses can have automatic-only restriction</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What About Expired Licenses?</h3>
      <p>You can translate an expired license, but RTA has rules about how recently it expired:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Expired less than 6 months: Usually acceptable</li>
        <li>Expired 6 months to 2 years: May be accepted with proof of renewal pending</li>
        <li>Expired more than 2 years: May require fresh license from home country</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your license recently expired, consider getting it renewed before traveling to UAE if possible.</p>

      <h3>International Driving Permit (IDP)</h3>
      <p>An IDP is not a substitute for license translation in the conversion process. The RTA requires translation of your actual national license, not the IDP.</p>

      <p>However, an IDP is useful for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Temporary driving while waiting for UAE license</li>
        <li>Renting cars before conversion is complete</li>
        <li>Driving in other countries during UAE residence</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
      <ul class="mistake-list">
        <li><strong>Wrong translation provider:</strong> Only MOJ-certified translations are accepted</li>
        <li><strong>Expired eye test:</strong> Eye test results expire after certain period</li>
        <li><strong>Incorrect visa status:</strong> Tourists cannot convert licenses; residency required</li>
        <li><strong>Missing original license:</strong> RTA needs to see original, not just translation</li>
        <li><strong>Name mismatch:</strong> License name must match passport spelling</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Realistic Timeline</h3>
      <p>The translation itself takes 2-4 hours standard, 60 minutes express. The full RTA process for approved countries typically takes 1-2 days including translation, eye test, typing, and RTA visit. For non-approved countries requiring testing, add 2-4 weeks for driving lessons and test scheduling.</p>

      <div class="info-callout">
        <h4><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Abu Dhabi and Other Emirates</h4>
        <p>The approved country list is UAE-wide, but specific procedures may vary slightly between Dubai RTA, Abu Dhabi DOT, and other emirate authorities. Our translation is accepted across all emirates.</p>
