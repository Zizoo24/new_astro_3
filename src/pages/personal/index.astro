  {
    question: 'What personal documents need MOJ-certified translation in the UAE?',
    answer: 'Documents needing MOJ certification include: birth certificates (visa, school enrollment), marriage certificates (spouse visa, family book), divorce and death certificates, academic degrees and transcripts, police clearance (employment visa, Golden Visa), bank statements (Golden Visa, property), driving licenses (RTA conversion), and medical reports. Any document for UAE government entities or courts requires MOJ certification.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does personal document translation take?',
    answer: 'Birth certificates, marriage certificates, and single-page documents complete in 4-6 hours. Academic transcripts (5-10 pages) take 24 hours. Bank statements (3-6 months) take 24-48 hours. Police clearance completes in 6-12 hours. Need it faster? We offer same-day rush for urgent deadlines.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do my documents need attestation before or after translation?',
    answer: 'Foreign documents typically need attestation before translation. The chain includes: home country notarization, Foreign Ministry authentication, UAE Embassy attestation, and MOFA stamp in UAE. We review your documents and advise on the proper sequence. UAE-issued certificates may only need translation—no attestation.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate documents for Golden Visa applications?',
    answer: 'Yes. We provide complete <a href="/services/golden-visa-translation/">Golden Visa translation packages</a>. This includes <a href="/personal/academic/degree/">degree certificates</a> with MOHESR coordination, professional licenses, bank statements, property title deeds, employment contracts, and salary certificates. We format everything for ICA requirements.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if my name is spelled differently on different documents?',
    answer: 'Name consistency is critical. 40% of rejections stem from name mismatches. We verify names match your Emirates ID and passport exactly. If your documents have spelling variations (common with transliterated names), we note this and can provide consistency letters. Send your Emirates ID and passport with your documents.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you translate documents from languages other than English?',
    answer: 'Yes. We translate from 40+ languages into Arabic for UAE use. Common pairs include Hindi, Urdu, Tagalog, Russian, French, German, Chinese, Spanish, and Portuguese. We also translate Arabic into English and other languages. All translations receive MOJ certification.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I submit documents for translation?',
    answer: 'Send clear photos or scans via WhatsApp to +971 50 862 0217. We accept photos, PDFs, and scans. Within 5-10 minutes, you get confirmation and a fixed quote. After payment, translation starts immediately. You receive digital copies first, with optional courier delivery anywhere in the UAE.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the cost of personal document translation?',
    answer: 'Single-page certificates (birth, marriage, degree) start at AED 150 per page with MOJ certification. Multi-page documents (5+ pages) get volume pricing at AED 120 per page. Express same-day adds 50%. The quoted price is final—no hidden fees for stamps or formatting.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you help with school enrollment document requirements?',
    answer: 'Yes. We translate birth certificates, school transcripts, transfer certificates, vaccination records, and parent passports. We know KHDA requirements for Dubai and ADEK requirements for Abu Dhabi. Documents are formatted for direct school submission.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if immigration or government rejects my translation?',
    answer: 'If any UAE entity rejects our translation due to our error, we fix it free. We also cover courier costs for redelivery. We know what GDRFA, ICA, MOHRE, DLD, and other entities expect. We format translations accordingly.'

      <p>Personal documents matter. They prove who you are and what you've achieved. The UAE requires MOJ-certified translations for official use.</p>

      <h3>Name Consistency: The #1 Rejection Reason</h3>

      <div class="warning-box">
        <h4><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Common Problem</h4>
        <p>Birth certificate says "Mohammed." Degree says "Muhammad." Passport says "Mohamed." Which one is you?</p>
      </div>

      <p>UAE authorities reject documents when names don't match exactly. This happens often with Arabic, Hindi, and Urdu names that have multiple English spellings.</p>

      <p><strong>Our solution:</strong> We check every name against your passport and Emirates ID. If variations exist, we note them and can provide a consistency letter.</p>

      <h3>Know Your Authority's Requirements</h3>

      <p>Different UAE authorities want different formats:</p>

      <div class="authority-requirements">
        <div class="req-item">
          <strong>GDRFA</strong>
          <span>Visa applications</span>

        <div class="req-item">
          <strong>MOHRE</strong>
          <span>Employment documents</span>
        </div>
        <div class="req-item">

          <strong>KHDA/ADEK</strong>
          <span>School enrollment</span>
        </div>
