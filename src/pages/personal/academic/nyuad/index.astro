<h3>For Current NYUAD Students</h3>
<p>International students at NYUAD bring documents from home countries that require translation for UAE residency and banking. Birth certificates, high school credentials, and family documents all need <a href="/services/legal-translation/">MOJ-certified translation</a> for official use in the Emirates.</p>

<p>Study abroad participants from NYUAD's global network may need documents translated when spending semesters in Abu Dhabi. We handle academic records from partner institutions including NYU New York and NYU Shanghai.</p>

<h3>For NYUAD Alumni</h3>
<p>NYUAD graduates entering the UAE job market need their <a href="/personal/academic/degree/">degree certificates</a> and <a href="/personal/academic/transcripts/">transcripts</a> translated for MOHRE work permit applications. Alumni pursuing graduate studies abroad may need Arabic translations of their NYUAD credentials for universities in MENA region countries.</p>

<p>Since NYUAD issues US-accredited degrees, alumni working internationally benefit from our experience with American academic terminology. Grade point averages, credit hours, and course titles translate accurately to international standards.</p>

<h3>For NYUAD Applicants</h3>
<p>Prospective students from Arabic-speaking countries need high school transcripts, standardized test scores, and personal documents translated to English for NYUAD admissions. We provide certified translations that meet university submission requirements.</p>

<p>Required documents for NYUAD application typically include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secondary school transcripts (official academic records)</li>
<li>School leaving certificates or equivalent</li>
<li>Standardized test score reports (if not in English)</li>
<li>Letters of recommendation (if originally in Arabic)</li>
<li>Personal identification documents</li>
</ul>

<div class="hero-highlight-box">
<h4>Abu Dhabi Priority Service</h4>
<p>NYUAD is located on Saadiyat Island in Abu Dhabi. We offer same-day pickup and delivery within Abu Dhabi for urgent translation needs. Students and staff can send documents via WhatsApp and collect certified translations the same day.</p>
</div>

<h3>Academic Terminology Standards</h3>
<p>NYUAD follows the American higher education system with some UAE-specific elements. Our translators understand both frameworks. We correctly translate:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Degree nomenclature</strong> — Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, honors designations</li>
<li><strong>GPA systems</strong> — 4.0 scale conversion and Latin honors (cum laude, magna cum laude)</li>
<li><strong>Course classifications</strong> — Core curriculum, major requirements, electives, capstone projects</li>
<li><strong>NYUAD-specific programs</strong> — Candidate in the Liberal Arts, January Term, global sites</li>
</ul>
