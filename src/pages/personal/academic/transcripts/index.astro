  },
  {
    question: 'Do you translate grades or just course names?',
    answer: 'We translate everything: course names, grades, credit hours, semester designations, cumulative GPA, class rank if shown, and any notations or remarks. The translation is a complete mirror of your original transcript in Arabic.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle different grading systems?',
    answer: 'We preserve your original grades exactly as shown and note the grading system used. A 3.8 GPA remains 3.8—we add notation explaining it is on a 4.0 scale. Percentage grades, letter grades, and other systems are all preserved with appropriate context for Arabic readers.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Are translated transcripts accepted for UAE university admission?',
    answer: 'Yes. UAE universities accept MOJ-certified transcript translations for admission evaluation. Some universities have specific formatting preferences—we can adjust layout if you provide their requirements. For credential evaluation by MOHESR, attested and translated transcripts are required.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do transcripts need attestation before translation?',
    answer: 'For MOHESR equivalency, yes—transcripts should complete the attestation chain before translation. For general employment or university preliminary review, translation alone may suffice. We advise based on your specific use case to avoid unnecessary attestation costs.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate transcripts in languages other than English?',
    answer: 'Yes. We translate transcripts from Chinese, Hindi, French, German, Spanish, Russian, and many other languages. University transcripts from non-English countries often use specialized academic vocabulary that our translators understand.'

  heroSubtitle="Academic Records"
  heroIntro={`<p>Academic transcripts contain your complete educational record—every course, grade, and credit that defines your qualifications. Accurate translation ensures UAE universities, MOHESR evaluators, and employers understand exactly what you achieved. We translate transcripts from universities worldwide with attention to academic terminology and grading systems.</p>

<h3>More Than a Degree Certificate</h3>
<p>Unlike a <a href="/personal/academic/degree/">degree certificate</a> that simply confirms completion, a transcript tells the full story of your education. Every course you took, every grade you earned, every credit you accumulated—this detailed record allows UAE institutions to evaluate not just that you have a degree, but what you actually studied and how well you performed.</p>

<h3>Technical Precision Required</h3>
<p>Transcript translation is technically demanding. A typical university transcript contains dozens or hundreds of course names, each requiring accurate translation. Engineering, medical, business, and humanities courses all use specialized terminology. Your grades must be preserved exactly as shown while noting the grading system—whether GPA on a 4.0 scale, percentage marks, letter grades, or class ranking systems.</p>

<h3>Grading Systems We Handle</h3>
<p>Different grading systems require careful handling. An <strong>American 4.0 GPA</strong> system works differently from <strong>British First/2:1/2:2</strong> classifications, <strong>Indian percentage</strong> systems, or <strong>German 1-5</strong> scales. We preserve your original grades exactly and note the grading system so evaluators understand what your marks represent. We do not convert grades—that is the evaluator's job.</p>

<h3>MOHESR Credential Equivalency</h3>
<p>For <strong>MOHESR credential equivalency</strong>, transcripts need the complete <a href="/services/attestation/">attestation</a> chain before translation. MOHESR evaluates whether your foreign degree is equivalent to UAE qualifications—affecting eligibility for government positions, further education, and certain professional roles.</p>

<h3>University Admissions</h3>
<p>UAE university admissions offices review translated transcripts when evaluating international applicants. Graduate programs examine undergraduate transcripts to assess academic preparation. Transfer students need transcript translations for credit evaluation. We can adjust presentation if you provide specific formatting requirements.</p>

<h3>Multi-Page Transcripts</h3>
<p>Multi-page transcripts are common for students with extensive coursework or transfer credits. Pricing is per page with volume discounts—a 10-page transcript costs less per page than shorter documents. Complex transcripts with medical, engineering, or legal terminology may require additional review time.</p>

<h3>Languages & Turnaround</h3>
<p>We translate transcripts from universities in <strong>India, Pakistan, China, Philippines, UK, USA, Canada</strong>, and across Europe and the Middle East. Languages include Hindi, Urdu, Chinese, Tagalog, French, German, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, and many others. Standard turnaround is 24-48 hours depending on length. Express service available for urgent deadlines.</p>`}

      <h2>Why Transcript Translation Requires Precision</h2>
      <p>Transcripts are dense documents packed with information that admissions officers and credential evaluators scrutinize carefully. A single mistranslated course name could misrepresent your qualifications. An incorrectly rendered grade could affect admission decisions or job offers.</p>
      
      <p>Our academic translators understand university terminology across different educational systems. They know that "Honours" in British universities differs from "Honors" in American ones. They recognize that a "First Class" degree, a 4.0 GPA, and a 90% average represent similar achievement levels in different systems.</p>
      
      <p>We preserve your grades exactly as they appear—we don't convert or interpret them. But we do provide context that helps Arabic readers understand what your grades mean within your educational system. This approach satisfies both accuracy requirements and practical usability.</p>
