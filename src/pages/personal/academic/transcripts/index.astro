  },
  {
    question: 'Do you translate grades or just course names?',
    answer: 'We translate everything: course names, grades, credit hours, semester designations, cumulative GPA, class rank if shown, and any notations or remarks. The translation is a complete mirror of your original transcript in Arabic.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle different grading systems?',
    answer: 'We preserve your original grades exactly as shown and note the grading system used. A 3.8 GPA remains 3.8—we add notation explaining it is on a 4.0 scale. Percentage grades, letter grades, and other systems are all preserved with appropriate context for Arabic readers.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Are translated transcripts accepted for UAE university admission?',
    answer: 'Yes. UAE universities accept MOJ-certified transcript translations for admission evaluation. Some universities have specific formatting preferences—we can adjust layout if you provide their requirements. For credential evaluation by MOHESR, attested and translated transcripts are required.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do transcripts need attestation before translation?',
    answer: 'For MOHESR equivalency, yes—transcripts should complete the attestation chain before translation. For general employment or university preliminary review, translation alone may suffice. We advise based on your specific use case to avoid unnecessary attestation costs.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate transcripts in languages other than English?',
    answer: 'Yes. We translate transcripts from Chinese, Hindi, French, German, Spanish, Russian, and many other languages. University transcripts from non-English countries often use specialized academic vocabulary that our translators understand.'

  heroIntro={`Academic transcripts contain your complete educational record—every course, grade, and credit that defines your qualifications. Accurate translation ensures UAE universities, MOHESR evaluators, and employers understand exactly what you achieved. We translate transcripts from universities worldwide with attention to academic terminology and grading systems.

Unlike a <a href="/personal/academic/degree/">degree certificate</a> that simply confirms completion, a transcript tells the full story of your education. Every course you took, every grade you earned, every credit you accumulated—this detailed record allows UAE institutions to evaluate not just that you have a degree, but what you actually studied and how well you performed. For university admissions, credential equivalency, and certain professional roles, this granular information matters.

Transcript translation is technically demanding. A typical university transcript contains dozens or hundreds of course names, each requiring accurate translation that preserves the subject matter. Engineering courses, medical courses, business courses, and humanities courses all use specialized terminology. Your grades must be preserved exactly as shown while noting the grading system used—whether GPA on a 4.0 scale, percentage marks, letter grades, or the class ranking systems used in various countries. Credit hours, semester designations, and cumulative calculations all need accurate rendering.

Different grading systems require careful handling. An American 4.0 GPA system works differently from British First/2:1/2:2 classifications, Indian percentage systems, or German 1-5 scales. We preserve your original grades exactly and note the grading system so evaluators understand what your marks represent. We do not convert grades between systems—that is the evaluator's job—but we ensure they have the information needed to make accurate assessments.

For MOHESR credential equivalency, transcripts need the complete <a href="/services/attestation/">attestation</a> chain before translation. MOHESR evaluates whether your foreign degree is equivalent to UAE qualifications—a determination that affects your eligibility for government positions, further education at UAE universities, and certain professional roles. The attested, translated transcript provides the detailed academic information MOHESR needs for this evaluation.

UAE university admissions offices review translated transcripts when evaluating applications from international students. Graduate programs examine undergraduate transcripts to assess academic preparation. Transfer students need transcript translations for credit evaluation. Each admissions office may have specific formatting preferences—we can adjust presentation if you provide their requirements.

Multi-page transcripts are common, especially for students with extensive coursework, multiple programs, or transfer credits. Pricing is per page with volume discounts for longer documents—a 10-page transcript costs less per page than shorter documents. Complex transcripts with specialized medical, engineering, or legal terminology may require additional review time to ensure accurate subject-specific translation.

We translate transcripts from universities in India, Pakistan, China, Philippines, UK, USA, Canada, and across Europe and the Middle East. Languages include Hindi, Urdu, Chinese, Tagalog, French, German, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, and many others. Academic terminology is consistent across our translations, so a course in organic chemistry translates the same way regardless of what language the original transcript uses.

Standard transcript translation takes 24-48 hours depending on length and complexity. Multi-page transcripts with hundreds of courses may need additional time. Express service is available when you have admissions deadlines or urgent credential evaluation requirements.`}

      <h2>Why Transcript Translation Requires Precision</h2>
      <p>Transcripts are dense documents packed with information that admissions officers and credential evaluators scrutinize carefully. A single mistranslated course name could misrepresent your qualifications. An incorrectly rendered grade could affect admission decisions or job offers.</p>
      
      <p>Our academic translators understand university terminology across different educational systems. They know that "Honours" in British universities differs from "Honors" in American ones. They recognize that a "First Class" degree, a 4.0 GPA, and a 90% average represent similar achievement levels in different systems.</p>
      
      <p>We preserve your grades exactly as they appear—we don't convert or interpret them. But we do provide context that helps Arabic readers understand what your grades mean within your educational system. This approach satisfies both accuracy requirements and practical usability.</p>
