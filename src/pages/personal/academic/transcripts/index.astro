  },
  {
    question: 'Do you translate grades or just course names?',
    answer: 'We translate everything: course names, grades, credit hours, semester designations, cumulative GPA, class rank if shown, and any notations or remarks. The translation is a complete mirror of your original transcript in Arabic.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle different grading systems?',
    answer: 'We preserve your original grades exactly as shown and note the grading system used. A 3.8 GPA remains 3.8—we add notation explaining it is on a 4.0 scale. Percentage grades, letter grades, and other systems are all preserved with appropriate context for Arabic readers.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Are translated transcripts accepted for UAE university admission?',
    answer: 'Yes. UAE universities accept MOJ-certified transcript translations for admission evaluation. Some universities have specific formatting preferences—we can adjust layout if you provide their requirements. For credential evaluation by MOHESR, attested and translated transcripts are required.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do transcripts need attestation before translation?',
    answer: 'For MOHESR equivalency, yes—transcripts should complete the attestation chain before translation. For general employment or university preliminary review, translation alone may suffice. We advise based on your specific use case to avoid unnecessary attestation costs.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate transcripts in languages other than English?',
    answer: 'Yes. We translate transcripts from Chinese, Hindi, French, German, Spanish, Russian, and many other languages. University transcripts from non-English countries often use specialized academic vocabulary that our translators understand.'

<h3>Why Transcript Translations Get Rejected</h3>
<p><strong>MOHESR</strong> and university admissions offices reject translations with common errors. Course names require specialized academic vocabulary—"Organic Chemistry" has a specific Arabic term that differs from everyday language. Grade conversions done incorrectly misrepresent your achievement. Credit hours must match exactly. GPA calculations need to preserve both the value and the scale. Our translators understand academic terminology because they have university backgrounds, not just language skills.</p>

<h3>MOHESR Credential Equivalency</h3>
<p>For <strong>MOHESR credential equivalency</strong>, transcripts need the complete <a href="/services/attestation/">attestation</a> chain before translation. MOHESR evaluates whether your foreign degree is equivalent to UAE qualifications—affecting eligibility for government positions, further education, and certain professional licenses. We ensure your translated transcript meets MOHESR formatting expectations so evaluators can process your application efficiently.</p>

<h3>University Admissions Support</h3>
<p>UAE universities require transcript translations for international applicants. Graduate programs at <strong>UAE University</strong>, <strong>American University of Sharjah</strong>, and <strong>NYU Abu Dhabi</strong> evaluate undergraduate transcripts to assess academic preparation. Transfer students need detailed transcript translations for credit evaluation. We can adjust presentation if specific formatting is required by your target institution.</p>

      <h2>Why Transcript Translation Requires Precision</h2>
      <p>Transcripts are dense documents packed with information that admissions officers and credential evaluators scrutinize carefully. A single mistranslated course name could misrepresent your qualifications. An incorrectly rendered grade could affect admission decisions or job offers.</p>
      
      <p>Our academic translators understand university terminology across different educational systems. They know that "Honours" in British universities differs from "Honors" in American ones. They recognize that a "First Class" degree, a 4.0 GPA, and a 90% average represent similar achievement levels in different systems.</p>
      
      <p>We preserve your grades exactly as they appear—we don't convert or interpret them. But we do provide context that helps Arabic readers understand what your grades mean within your educational system. This approach satisfies both accuracy requirements and practical usability.</p>
