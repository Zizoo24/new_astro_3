    question: 'How are multi-page transcripts priced?',
    answer: 'Transcripts are priced per page, with discounts for longer documents. A 5-page transcript costs less per page than five single-page certificates. We provide exact quotes after reviewing your transcript—send a photo via WhatsApp for immediate pricing.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you translate grades or just course names?',
    answer: 'We translate everything: course names, grades, credit hours, semester designations, cumulative GPA, class rank if shown, and any notations or remarks. The translation is a complete mirror of your original transcript in Arabic.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle different grading systems?',
    answer: 'We preserve your original grades exactly as shown and note the grading system used. A 3.8 GPA remains 3.8—we add notation explaining it is on a 4.0 scale. Percentage grades, letter grades, and other systems are all preserved with appropriate context for Arabic readers.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Are translated transcripts accepted for UAE university admission?',
    answer: 'Yes. UAE universities accept MOJ-certified transcript translations for admission evaluation. Some universities have specific formatting preferences—we can adjust layout if you provide their requirements. For credential evaluation by MOHESR, attested and translated transcripts are required.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do transcripts need attestation before translation?',
    answer: 'For MOHESR equivalency, yes—transcripts should complete the attestation chain before translation. For general employment or university preliminary review, translation alone may suffice. We advise based on your specific use case to avoid unnecessary attestation costs.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate transcripts in languages other than English?',
    answer: 'Yes. We translate transcripts from Chinese, Hindi, French, German, Spanish, Russian, and many other languages. University transcripts from non-English countries often use specialized academic vocabulary that our translators understand.'

      <h2>Why Transcript Translation Requires Precision</h2>
      <p>Transcripts are dense documents packed with information that admissions officers and credential evaluators scrutinize carefully. A single mistranslated course name could misrepresent your qualifications. An incorrectly rendered grade could affect admission decisions or job offers.</p>
      
      <p>Our academic translators understand university terminology across different educational systems. They know that "Honours" in British universities differs from "Honors" in American ones. They recognize that a "First Class" degree, a 4.0 GPA, and a 90% average represent similar achievement levels in different systems.</p>
      
      <p>We preserve your grades exactly as they appear—we don't convert or interpret them. But we do provide context that helps Arabic readers understand what your grades mean within your educational system. This approach satisfies both accuracy requirements and practical usability.</p>
