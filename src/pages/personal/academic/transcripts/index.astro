  },
  {
    question: 'Do you translate grades or just course names?',
    answer: 'We translate everything: course names, grades, credit hours, semester designations, cumulative GPA, class rank if shown, and any notations or remarks. The translation is a complete mirror of your original transcript in Arabic.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle different grading systems?',
    answer: 'We preserve your original grades exactly as shown and note the grading system used. A 3.8 GPA remains 3.8—we add notation explaining it is on a 4.0 scale. Percentage grades, letter grades, and other systems are all preserved with appropriate context for Arabic readers.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Are translated transcripts accepted for UAE university admission?',
    answer: 'Yes. UAE universities accept MOJ-certified transcript translations for admission evaluation. Some universities have specific formatting preferences—we can adjust layout if you provide their requirements. For credential evaluation by MOHESR, attested and translated transcripts are required.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do transcripts need attestation before translation?',
    answer: 'For MOHESR equivalency, yes—transcripts should complete the attestation chain before translation. For general employment or university preliminary review, translation alone may suffice. We advise based on your specific use case to avoid unnecessary attestation costs.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate transcripts in languages other than English?',
    answer: 'Yes. We translate transcripts from Chinese, Hindi, French, German, Spanish, Russian, and many other languages. University transcripts from non-English countries often use specialized academic vocabulary that our translators understand.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What causes MOHESR to reject transcript translations?',
    answer: 'MOHESR rejects translations for course name terminology errors, GPA miscalculations, missing credit hours, and grading scale confusion. Literal translations of course names often fail—academic subjects have specific Arabic terminology that differs from everyday language. We use standardized academic vocabulary that MOHESR evaluators recognize.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does transcript translation take?',
    answer: 'Standard transcripts (1-3 pages) complete within 24-48 hours. Longer transcripts with extensive course listings may require 48-72 hours for thorough translation and verification. Rush service is available for urgent university deadlines—we can expedite most transcripts to same-day completion with advance notice.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate partial transcripts or single semesters?',
    answer: 'Yes. Some universities or employers only need specific semesters or year-end summaries. We translate exactly what you provide. However, for MOHESR equivalency, complete transcripts showing all courses toward your degree are typically required.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you handle supplementary academic documents?',
    answer: 'Yes. We translate course syllabi, academic catalogs, graduation verification letters, and enrollment certificates alongside transcripts. For credential evaluation, these supplementary documents often provide context that evaluators need.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if my university uses a unique grading system?',
    answer: 'Universities worldwide use varied grading systems—pass/fail, letter grades with different scales, percentage marks, class rankings, or competency-based assessments. We preserve your exact grades and include notation explaining the grading system to Arabic readers. This context helps evaluators understand your achievement level.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you translate electronic transcripts or PDFs?',
    answer: 'Yes. Most universities now issue electronic transcripts. We accept PDF transcripts, screenshots of student portals, and official electronic documents. The translation receives the same MOJ certification regardless of source format. For credential evaluation, ensure your electronic transcript includes institutional verification marks.'

<h3>Why Transcript Translations Get Rejected</h3>
<p><strong>MOHESR</strong> and university admissions offices reject translations with common errors. Course names require specialized academic vocabulary—"Organic Chemistry" has a specific Arabic term that differs from everyday language. Grade conversions done incorrectly misrepresent your achievement. Credit hours must match exactly. GPA calculations need to preserve both the value and the scale. Our translators understand academic terminology because they have university backgrounds, not just language skills.</p>

<h3>MOHESR Credential Equivalency</h3>
<p>For <strong>MOHESR credential equivalency</strong>, transcripts need the complete <a href="/services/attestation/">attestation</a> chain before translation. MOHESR evaluates whether your foreign degree is equivalent to UAE qualifications—affecting eligibility for government positions, further education, and certain professional licenses. We ensure your translated transcript meets MOHESR formatting expectations so evaluators can process your application efficiently.</p>

<h3>University Admissions Support</h3>

      <h2>Why Transcript Translation Requires Precision</h2>
      <p>Transcripts are dense documents packed with information that admissions officers and credential evaluators scrutinize carefully. A single mistranslated course name could misrepresent your qualifications. An incorrectly rendered grade could affect admission decisions or job offers.</p>
      
      <p>Our academic translators understand university terminology across different educational systems. They know that "Honours" in British universities differs from "Honors" in American ones. They recognize that a "First Class" degree, a 4.0 GPA, and a 90% average represent similar achievement levels in different systems.</p>
      
      <p>We preserve your grades exactly as they appear—we don't convert or interpret them. But we do provide context that helps Arabic readers understand what your grades mean within your educational system. This approach satisfies both accuracy requirements and practical usability.</p>

      <h3>Processing Timelines and Delivery</h3>
      <p>Standard transcript translations (1-3 pages) complete within 24-48 hours. Longer transcripts with extensive course listings—common for students who changed majors, transferred credits, or completed multiple degrees—may require 48-72 hours for thorough translation and terminology verification. Medical school and engineering transcripts with specialized coursework require additional review time.</p>

      <p>Rush service is available for urgent university application deadlines. We can expedite most transcripts to same-day completion with advance notice. For application deadlines, we recommend submitting documents at least 72 hours before your deadline to allow time for quality review and any clarification if needed.</p>

      <p>Digital delivery is immediate upon completion—we email PDF versions suitable for online portal uploads. Physical copies with original MOJ certification stamps can be couriered within Dubai the same day or next-day for other emirates. Universities requiring mailed transcripts should allow additional postal time.</p>

      <h3><a href="/resources/mohesr-equivalency/">MOHESR Credential Equivalency</a> Requirements</h3>
      <p>The Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MOHESR) evaluates foreign degrees for UAE equivalency. See our <a href="/resources/mohesr-equivalency/">complete MOHESR equivalency guide</a> to understand when you need equivalency vs just translation. MOHESR requires translated transcripts alongside translated <a href="/personal/academic/degree/">degree certificates</a> to assess your educational background. Have a <a href="/resources/distance-education-uae/">distance education degree</a>? MOHESR evaluates these on a case-by-case basis.</p>

      <p>For <a href="/resources/mohesr-equivalency/">MOHESR submissions</a>, transcripts must complete the full <a href="/resources/attestation-guide/">attestation chain</a> before translation. This typically involves notarization by your university, apostille from <a href="/services/attestation/india/">India</a>, <a href="/services/attestation/uk/">UK</a>, <a href="/services/attestation/us/">USA</a>, or other Hague countries, and <a href="/services/attestation/mofa/">UAE MOFA attestation</a>. See our <a href="/resources/attestation-guide/">attestation guide</a> for country-specific requirements.</p>

      <p>MOHESR evaluators compare your coursework against UAE degree requirements. Transcript translations must use standardized academic terminology that evaluators recognize. For <a href="/services/golden-visa-translation/">Golden Visa</a> applications, transcripts complement your <a href="/personal/academic/degree/">degree certificate translation</a>. Check our <a href="/resources/golden-visa-checklist/">Golden Visa checklist</a> for complete document requirements.</p>

      <h3>University Admission Applications</h3>
      <p>UAE universities require transcript translations for international applicant evaluation. Graduate programs at UAE University, American University of Sharjah, NYU Abu Dhabi, and other institutions evaluate undergraduate transcripts to assess academic preparation. Our translations present your coursework in formats these admissions offices expect.</p>

      <p>Transfer students need detailed transcript translations for credit evaluation. Universities assess which courses transfer toward their degree requirements. Clear course name translations and accurate credit hour notation help registrars determine equivalencies efficiently. We can include course descriptions if available from your original institution.</p>

      <p>Some universities have specific formatting requirements for translated documents. If your target institution provides formatting guidelines, share them with us and we adjust presentation accordingly while maintaining MOJ certification requirements.</p>
